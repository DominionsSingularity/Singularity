The Jade Amazons are known for their skill in magic. Their warriors can be quickly levied in the defense of Sinkiang and their homes, and to prove themselves in battle. After the battle is concluded, they will return to their tribe. They will bring their own equipment and therefore cost almost no resources."

In the Great Desert the Jinnun and their human servants have built a Hidden Kingdom. Their Caravans come every summer bringing frankincense and marvelous goods from the Hidden Land. The caravan riders are not just simple merchants. Swordplay is an important part of life and every member of a caravan is an accomplished warrior trained in mounted combat. Caravans readily raid unsuspecting victims, should their masters wish it. Falconry is popular among the desert tribes and many camel riders own a falcon. Some caravaneers build semi-permanent settlements in the wastelands of Sinkiang and can be recruited for a price. They believe in the Jinnun and their gods and will cause unrest wherever they go. They bring their own equipment and cost few resources though they demand more pay then they would in their homeland."

#copyspr 6700
#name "King"
#descr "The Kings of Sinkiang are accomplished rulers, mages, diviners and priests. Although quite capable at commanding armies, they mostly spend their time in matters of ruling, magic and religion. All Kings are required to be able to perform divination as well, and thus will help see and prevent unfavourable events. Divination magic can take on many forms - some seek advice from the dead or break bones, while others interpret natural phenomena to try to discern the future. They are also required to know the magic of the astral planes and death to be able to consult the ancestors. As the members of the royal family, their rule is ensured by the Mandate of Heaven and thus are considered sacred and are trained as powerful priests. They are protected in battles by the spirits of their ancestors. Should a king ever fall in battle, his mortal remains will be taken to the capital and a Jade Suit made to encase them. Then the higher spirit soul, Hun, is called back from Xian to inhabit the vessel once more and guide the people. To appease the spirit, offerings of gold, food and even human sacrifices must be made on a monthly basis. They are driven on chariots and never show their hands. Should the chariot be destroyed the retainers will sacrifice themselves to save the king, who will continue to fight on foot, more ancestral spirits coming to his aid in the time of need."

#name "Caravan Sahir"
#descr "Sinkiang is the beginning of the Jade Road, a vast trade route between the Lands of the Dragons and the Great Desert. In the Great Desert the Jinnun and their human servants have built a Hidden Kingdom. Their Caravans come every summer bringing frankincense and marvelous goods from the Hidden Land. While the vast majority of caravans are led by Sheiks, the Jinnun sometimes send well trained Sahirs on long and dangerous routes, such as the Jade Road. They do this not only for the extra protection, but also to sense hidden magic in trade items and spy the magical capabilities of distant kingdoms. The Sahir is a sorcerer of Sahar, the magic of the Jinnun. They can be recruited in the capital when the Caravan arrives. They believe in the Jinnun and their gods and will lower dominion wherever they go. They bring their own equipment and cost few resources though they demand considerably more pay then they would in their homeland. The Sahir have their own agenda. Sabotage, assassinations and worse are not unheard of should the opportunity present itself."

Although widely practiced, divination is not considered holy work, even when seeking advice from the dead. Thus diviners have neither priestly powers nor are considered holy."

#newspell -- Release the Po
#copyspell 979
#name "Release the Po"
#descr "It is taught that each person possesses two souls. The spirit-soul (Hun) which, upon death, travels to Xian, the paradise of immortals. The body-soul (Po), is left in the body until proper ceremonies are performed to reunite it with the Hun in Xian. Necromancers usually use the body-soul to reanimate the undead. With this spell a Sinkiang death mage will pull the body-soul from an undead being, killing all but the most powerful undead outright. The Po will manifest itself as a dispossessed spirit."

#descr "Between the lands of the Dragons where legendary T'ien Ch'i lies and the great steps of Sauromatia lies the Kingdom of Sinkiang, known as the Jade Kingdom. Jade is used to commute with the spirits of the ancestors inhabiting the paradise of immortals - Xian. Ancestors help guide the kingdom, change the fortunes and even participate in battles. Jade is also exported. Sinkiang is the beginning of the famed Jade road that connects it to the Great Desert and the lands of the Jinnun. Every fall the caravans arrive with the riches of Ubar, and every spring they leave with the crafts of the Jade Kingdom. Many peoples live in the kingdom - jade amazons that can be levied for single battles, the nomadic steppe warriors, the conquered Yi, the Qin citizenry and the noble Shang, leaders of the kingdom."
#summary "Race: Humans, Spirits of the Ancestors.
Military: Light and medium infantry, primitive crossbows and chariots. Jade Amazon mercenaries that fight single battles.
