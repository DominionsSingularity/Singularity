#descr "In addition to the massive armies of regular soldiers that could be mustered in ancient Nehekhara there were many individual brotherhoods of warriors who swore loyalty to particular cities, Kings, branches of nobility, or even monuments to the gods. These warriors did not return to agricultural labour during the farming season, or assist in the construction of great works, but instead trained and fought year round and were known for their skill on the battlefield. Just as in their former lives, they are sought after additions to the army of any Tomb King. Like any other common undead of Nehekhara they were not buried with any particular ritual or preservation but are not mindless and are hard to banish. Nehekharan Warriors favour the use of two light blades and forgo the traditional shield, relying on a more offensive style of fighting.

The traditional weapon of the Tomb Guard is the khopesh, a curved hacking weapon peculiar to and perfected by ancient Nehekhara. The weapons of the Tomb Guard are imbued with powerful incantations by the Mortuary Cult and have only grown more deadly over thousands of years in the Tomb.

Ptra created the human race in his image and elevated the Nehekharans above all others, blessing them with his wisdom, glory, and the promise of an afterlife by his side for those who made the proper offerings. Each of the gods were served by their own priests and some had armed followers dedicated to keeping their sacred sites safe, but only the sacred warriors of Asaph and Ptra were forces powerful enough to rival the armies of Tomb Kings. The Guardians of Ptra carried spears blessed with the Great Father's burning wrath capable of searing unholy creatures from existence; they acted as a vital vanguard in the battles which saw Nagash defeated in the first great war against the necromancer. Though Ptra is now greatly diminished from the time of ancient Nehekhara his Guardians may still be raised to battle in his name at the command of the Tomb Kings. Being blessed by Ptra they are surrounded by a blinding light when they battle under the sun, for the Great Father's gaze falls kindly upon them still.

Stalkers are instinctively able to hunt down and ambush trespassers and are extremely quick, making them excellent patrollers, well feared by any who would dare tread the land of Nehekhara seeking to find treasure in the many ruins. The rituals that animate the Stalkers are complex and grant them both great resilience and a gaze capable of turning the flesh of mortals to marble. Even if the unfortunate target of the Stalker's gaze is not entirely changed to stone, they may well suffer terrible injuries as parts of them crumble into sand.

According to half eroded scripture on the oldest monuments they were the personal guard of the Nehekharan Gods who guarded against the incursion of daemons. The Mortuary Cult, at the height of their power before the rise of Nagash, constructed their own giant sentinels in honour of these legends, skeletal titans made of black marble known as Necrolith Colossi. To each Colossus was bound the spirit of a heroic warrior, a willing sacrifice made to protect the Tomb of their King that he might reach the glorious afterlife promised to him. Now the Mortuary Cult have set about awakening these long dormant protectors to once again march with the armies of Nehekhara. This Colossus is armed with a massive Khopesh capable of decapitating even mighty beasts, daemons, or giants.

#name "Necrolith Colossus Archer"
#descr "In ancient times, long before the rise of Settra and the founding of the Mortuary Cult, there were legends of beings of immense stature that walked the land. According to half eroded scripture on the oldest monuments they were the personal guard of the Nehekharan Gods who guarded against the incursion of daemons. The Mortuary Cult, at the height of their power before the rise of Nagash, constructed their own giant sentinels in honour of these legends, skeletal titans made of black marble known as Necrolith Colossi. To each Colossus was bound the spirit of a heroic warrior, a willing sacrifice made to protect the Tomb of their King that he might reach the glorious afterlife promised to him. Now the Mortuary Cult have set about awakening these long dormant protectors to once again march with the armies of Nehekhara. This Colossus is armed with an immensely powerful Bow of the Desert, an artifact capable of creating and launching massive arrows comprised of spiritual energy from the Underworld.

#name "Hierotitan"
#descr "Hierotitans were constructed to stand within the uppermost chamber of a Royal Tomb, acting as spirit guides for the deceased Kings and ushering them between the mortal world and the glorious afterlife. No expense was spared in their construction and their forms are lavished with gold and jewels. In one hand the Hierotitan carries an ornate staff bearing the hieroglyph of the Sun God Ptra, to light the way through the abyss that separates the mortal world from the afterlife and ward away the Daemons that sometimes prowl there. The Hierotitan's other hand carries the scales on which the soul of the King shall be judged by Usirian the God of the Underworld. Both of these items are potent magical artifacts, with the scales capable of unleashing holy judgement upon the foe and the staff able to emit beams of light that spare the servants of Nehekhara while scouring the enemy from existence. Within each Hierotitan is the mummified form of a great High Priest from the Mortuary Cult who died before the discovery of the secrets that allowed them to cheat death; it is this form which animates the Hierotitan and gives them their holy purpose. Such is the power of the Hierotitan that it spreads the dominion of Nehekhara with its presence and increases the winds of magic wherever it treads.

#name "Necropolis Knight"
#descr "Necropolis Knights are members of the Tomb Guard who ride atop giant snake-shaped statues known as Necroserpents. Necroserpents were originally sculpted to guard the entranceways to the temples of the Mortuary Cult, many of them taking the guise of the infamous hooded Khemrian cobra, though with embellishments of skulls and other death imgaery. The venom of the Khemrian cobra was legendary, able to cause total paralysis within a matter of seconds, and the fangs of the Necroserpents mysteriously drip with the same substance. At the foot of each Necroserpent statue lay a small tomb containing the remains of one who, despite years of honourable service in the elite forces of his King, felt he had become in some way dishonoured and had sacrificed his life to the Cobra god Qu'aph, whose venom can cleanse any sin. With the rise of the Tomb Kings and undead Nehekhara the souls of these fallen soldiers were bound to the statues and they awoke as one, powerful knights in service of their King once again. Should the Knight be struck down the Necroserpent will fight on and if victorious the remains of the rider will reassemble to ride atop his bonded mount once more.

#descr "Carrion are giant undead birds reminiscent of the black desert vultures of ancient Nehekhara but far larger and more aggressive. They once lived in the mountains to the east of Nehekhara and would descend to feast on the slain and wounded in the wake of great battles; no commoner dared raise a hand against them for they were sacred beasts, agents of Ualatp, who bore the spirits of lost warriors to the sky to battle Daemons in an unending war. Some Kings sought to seize the favour of Ualatp and his warrior hosts in the afterlife and so had Carrion embalmed and entombed alongside them by the thousands. When the Tomb Kings arose so too did the Carrion and now they prowl Nehekhara once more and are often bound to the will of Liche Priests in service of a King. Unlike most Nehekharan undead Carrion are known to disobey the bidding of their master and flee battle at times, for they retain their animalistic sense of self preservation. As agents of Ualatp even in death the Carrion are sacred.

Though long dead they have become infused with dark magics of undeath over the centuries and can be returned to a state of animation by a simple incantation from even a minor Liche Priest. Most of these scuttling creatures are resigned to the duty of cleaning up the remains of interlopers to the Tomb Kings' realm, but the reanimated corpse of the Khepra Scorpion, a particularly large and aggressive variety found only in Nehekhara, is often used in battle to overwhelm or distract enemy troops. Though these creatures are dangerous pests alone, in sufficient numbers they become a terrifying tide of chitinous death rolling over the desert, swarming over and stinging to death anything that lives."

Only in service to Khemri, though, would the Mortuary Cult animate these massive statues to wage war, tearing through the enemy ranks with a howdah of elite soldiers on their back. With the rise of the Tomb Kings the Warsphinxes are once more being awakened, now crewed by Tomb Guard, to once more devastate the enemies of Nehekhara. Warsphinxes are incredibly hardly, nearly industructible by normal means, and are capable of breathing gouts of fire said to be drawn from the endless funeral pyres of the unworthy dead.

After the fall of Nehekhara and the rise of the Tomb Kings, such clandestine operations remained out of the question, and when a scout is needed a skeletal Horseman is enchanted with somewhat expensive inscriptions of stealth and misdirection before being sent to watch for enemy activity. As such simple constructs they require no upkeep.

#descr "In ancient Nehekhara every King and Prince could call upon their own personal Herald, a bodyguard, standard bearer, and champion that represented their master in martial matters beneath their attention. Heralds were selected from the best of the elite bodyguards and had to pass a gauntlet of trials of bravery, skill, and endurance. In battle they wore ceremonial armour and bore an icon of their master at all times while wearing a golden mask in the likeness of their ruler. Upon the death of the King or Prince the Herald was ritually sacrificed and placed guard at the entrance to their Tomb chamber. Though Heralds were not mummified the rituals preserving them and proximity to their ruler have granted them considerable physical strength and magical resistance, in addition to almost fully preserving the memories of their former life. Heralds, as representatives of members of a royal dynasty, have considerable martial authority and are considered sacred, though they cannot command the magically animated constructs of Nehekhara.

Acolytes are the most numerous and lowest status members of the Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult and were responsible for the majority of day to day observances and burial rites in ancient Nehekhara.

Liche Priests are the foundation of the Mortuary Cult's power, as they have considerable magical talent and priestly authority along with sufficient numbers to ensure the continued functioning of Nehekhara in undeath. Priests see magic as being a gift from the Gods and in addition to the lore of death they study and practice the magic of sand, stone, the desert winds, and the sun and moon.

#descr "In life Necrotects were the artisans and engineers that designed and oversaw the construction of the great monuments, pyraminds, and Royal Tombs of ancient Nehekhara, as well as the countless statues that could be called to war. Theirs was a highly demanding profession that carried great prestige and those with talent were highly sought after by competing members of the Mortuary Cult, dynastic Royals and even the most powerful Priest Kings. Upon their death they were inevitably granted expensive burial rites and mummification and entombed alongside their masters that they might continue to serve in the glorious afterlife. Their status has only risen since Nehekhara's fall and rise once more as a land of undeath ruled by the Tomb Kings, for the Necrotects are repositories of knowledge from their respective eras that would otherwise be totally lost, and their importance is further highlighted by the fact their works still dominate the Nehekharan landscape. While in life the Necrotects had no magical power in death they are blessed with a new connection to the arcana of sand, stone, death, and shadow. In battle they constantly chant mantras with the power to heal damage dealt to the animated statues of Nehekhara.

#name "Cursed Scarab Prince"
#descr "Apophas was an ambitious and jealous prince of Numas who covted the throne of that city. To this end he drugged and slit the throats of the entire royal line, declaring himself King. He proved a ruthless but unpopular ruler and lost the support of the Mortuary Cult, leaving him vulberable to a rebellion which saw him dragged to the temple for judgement. His punishment was severe: to be devoured by scarab beetles such that he would never reach the glorious afterlife. All that was left of Apophas was his skull, which was marked with cursed glyphs and cast into the desert. Apophas' soul was claimed by Usirian, God of the Underworld, but Apophas struck a bargain with the deity: he would return to the world and find a soul even more ruthless and ambitious than his own to replace him in the Underworld. Usirian agreed, but returned Apophas to the mortal realms in the guise of a writhing swarm of scarab beetles, armed with a blade that can reap souls. Usirian now seeks out the most powerful and dangerous foes that he might finally find a soul to match his own and be freed from his eternal servitude. Should Apophas be struck down within the dominion of Nehehkhara he will swiftly return to undeath, indeed he has been known at times to disperse and reform within seconds.

#name "Grand Hierophant"
#descr "Khatep is the Grand Hierophant of Khemri, the head of the Mortuary Cult's hieratic council, and he alone knows all of its secrets and unwritten lore. He is the oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, said to be the very first of their number to successfully stave of death. Following Nagash's Great Ritual which killed the entire population of Nehekhara and then animated and bound every last one of the dead, entombed or otherwise, to his will, Khatep and his followers waited for their moment to take action. Nagash, felled at the height of his power by the sole living human in Nehekhara, lost control of the Tomb Kings and the proud monarchs, free willed once more and full of wrath, each sought to reign their former realms supreme. So began a great and terrible civil war of the dead. It was Khatep who took decisive action; he broke the seals of the Tomb of Settra, the only such structure to have resisted the power of the Great Ritual, and personally awoke the greatest of the Nehehkharan Kings. Settra quickly restored a new order to Nehekhara, but turned on Khatep with a great and terrible fury, for he had been promised an eternal glorious afterlife in paradise, not rulership of a fallen land of undeath. Khatep was banished to the desert, only to return when Nehehkhara could be restored to the promised paradise. With the coming of the War of Ascension, Khatep has returned to serve the Tomb Kings, and Settra, once more.

#name "Necrotect Visionary"
#descr "Ramhotep of Quatar is generally recognised as the greatest Necrotect who ever lived and, in death, still the most talented of his mysterious kind and a mage of some power. Ramhotep was the mind behind the Necropolis of Rasetra, the Monoliths of the Great Plains, the Monuments of Eternal Death and many other wonders of Nehekhara. His own tomb, the Sepulchre of the Heavens built in Quatar, was nearly the rival of the Grand Pyramid of Khemri in some ways, though far smaller in scale. With the fall and rise of Nehekhara Ramhotep was awoken to find not only the promised paradise, but a world in which many of his great works had been lost or terrible damaged, horriying the Necrotect Visionary. As he was driven in life to create greater and greater wonders, he is now driven in death to obsessively recover, restore, and protect his legacy and wreak vengeance upon those who have looted and defiled his works of art. Ramhotep's desire for vengeance is such that he enters each battle filled with hateful vigour drawn from the earth to which so many of his works were consigned.

According to half eroded scripture on the oldest monuments they were the personal guard of the Nehekharan Gods who guarded against the incursion of daemons. The Mortuary Cult, at the height of their power before the rise of Nagash, constructed their own giant sentinels in honour of these legends, skeletal titans made of black marble known as Necrolith Colossi. To each Colossus was bound the spirit of a heroic warrior, a willing sacrifice made to protect the Tomb of their King that he might reach the glorious afterlife promised to him. By calling out to the spirit of the warrior still bound to the silent Colossus and infusing its black marble bones with magic, the caster awakens one of these protectors of Nehekhara to march to war once more. The awakened Colossus will be armed with either a massive khopesh or a powerful bow capable of drawing power from the underworld."

By offering a tribute of magic and dust the caster animates four of these sentinels to once again stride forth and crush the enemies of Nehekhara.

Sepulchral Stalkers were created by the ancient Nehekharans to dilineate the borders of a King's realm. They are statues that have the boy of a snake and the upper torso of a man, topped with a thoroughly inhuman and repulsive skull-like visage. Stalkers are instinctively able to hunt down and ambush trespassers and are extremely quick, making them excellent patrollers, well feared by any who would dare tread the land of Nehekhara seeking to find treasure in the many ruins. The rituals that animate the Stalkers are complex and grant them both great resilience and a gaze capable of turning the flesh of mortals to marble."

#newspell
#name "Tomb that Scuttles"
#descr "The caster seeks out one of the restless Tomb Scorpions that prowl the deepest, darkest recesses of the great Necropoleis of ancient Nehekhara and binds the spirit of the High Priest entombed within to a mission of vengeance. They are sacred creations of the Mortuary Cult, formed from a combination of stone, metal, and bone. They are lethal foes, for a Tomb Scorpions tail carries a potent venomous sting and their pincers can slice even an armoured man in half. They are sculpted by Necrotects in the form of Usirian's great scorpion companions which guard the gate to the Underworld and each Scorpion also acts as a sarcophagus in which the remains of a fallen Liche High Priest are interred."

These massive leonine statues of gold, marble, and bone were first constructed to guard the entranceways to the inner sanctums of entombed Kings. Once animated they are crewed with Tomb Guard and can be sent to tear through the ranks of the enemy. Warshpinxes are terrifying, extremely durable, and capable of breathing great gouts of fire said to be drawn from the endless funeral pyres of the unworthy dead."

#newspell
#name "Animate Necropolis Knights"
#descr "The caster calls to the cursed winds of Nehekhara to breathe movement and undeath back into four statues of Necroserpents and the Necropolis Knights that ride them. Necroserpents were originally sculpted to guard the entranceways to the temples of the Mortuary Cult, many of them taking the guise of the infamous hooded Khemrian cobra, though with embellishments of skulls and other death imgaery. The venom of the Khemrian cobra was legendary, able to cause total paralysis within a matter of seconds, and the fangs of the Necroserpents mysteriously drip with the same substance. At the foot of each Necroserpent statue lay a small tomb containing the remains of one who, despite years of honourable service in the elite forces of his King, felt he had become in some way dishonoured and had sacrificed his life to the Cobra god Qu'aph, whose venom can cleanse any sin."

#name "Nehekhara"
#epithet "Tomb Kings"
#descr "The lands of Nehekhara were once vast and fertile and for more than a thousand years it prospered and grew in influence, ruled by Priest Kings, each of whom controlled a city state. Greatest amongst the Priest Kings was Settra, first to unify Nehekhara under his authority, and it was Settra who brought the Mortuary Cult to power, for he wished to find a way to conquer death itself and rule eternally. Though the Cult could prolong the lives of their rulers greatly, they could not stave off death entirely, and instead promised a future glorious eternal afterlife. This promise led directly to the Nehekharan obsession with death and countless tombs were created to house the Royal families of Nehekhara as generations passed, until the riches of the dead far outweighed those of the living. Nehekhara's fate came in the form of Nagash, a genius Priest turned Necromancer who wrought the Great Ritual that laid waste to the land, slew every living soul, and bound the dead to his will in a state of undeath. Nagash was fortunately defeated and the risen Kings of Nehekhara regained their free will, but found they now ruled over a blasted land of undeath. Yet mummified undead Kings are Kings still, generations of rulers accustomed to unquestioned authority and power, and they now set forth with their numberless undead legions and animated statues to reclaim their lost empire."
#summary "Race: undead humans, prefers Heat Scale +2, halved income and pop loss from death
Military: shielded infantry, archers, and chariots with powerful and resilient animated statues
Magic: Death with Fire, Air, Astral, and Earth
Priests: Strong, with chants that strengthen the undead
Mechanics: No indies or mercs, troops have no upkeep, death scale gold discount, statues require lab and temple, recruitment unlocks at dominion 1, 2, 4, 6"
#brief "Nehekhara was once a mighty nation of city states until its entire population was struck down by the necromancer Nagash and raised as his undead servants. With his defeat the Tomb Kings are free willed once more but cursed with undeath and obsessed with rebuilding their shattered kingdoms."
