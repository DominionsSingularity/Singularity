#descr "Sinkiang is the beginning of the Jade Road, a vast trade route between the lands of the dragons and the great desert of the Jinnun. The Jinnun and their human servants have built a hidden kingdom and their caravans come every summer bringing frankincense and marvelous goods from the hidden land. But the caravan riders are not just simple merchants. Swordplay is an important part of life and every member of a caravan is an accomplished warrior trained in mounted combat. Caravans readily raid unsuspecting victims, should their masters wish it. Falconry is popular among the desert tribes and many camel riders own a falcon. Some caravaneers build semi-permanent settlements in the wastelands of Sinkiang and can be recruited for a price. They believe in the Jinnun and their gods and will cause unrest wherever they go. They bring their own equipment and cost few resources though they demand considerably more pay then they would in their homeland."

As the members of the royal family, their rule is ensured by the Mandate of Heaven and thus are considered sacred and have some priestly power. They are protected in battles by the spirits of their ancestors. Should a queen ever fall in battle, her mortal remains will be taken to the capital and a Jade Suit made to encase them. Then the higher spirit soul, Hun, is called back from Xian to inhabit the vessel once more and guide the people. To appease the spirit, offerings of gold, food and even human sacrifices must be made on a monthly basis."

#descr "The Queens of Sinkiang have been greatly influenced by the Amazons living in the Jade Kingdom. While the kings are high priests, mages and bureaucrats, queens are in charge of military campaigns and are accomplished warriors. To that end they are taught magic skills to aid them in battle. As the members of the royal family, their rule is ensured by the Mandate of Heaven and thus are considered sacred and have some priestly power. They are protected in battles by the spirits of their ancestors. Should a queen ever fall in battle, her mortal remains will be taken to the capital and a Jade Suit made to encase them. Then the higher spirit soul, Hun, is called back from Xian to inhabit the vessel once more and guide the people. To appease the spirit, offerings of gold, food and even human sacrifices must be made on a monthly basis."

Then the higher spirit soul, Hun, is called back from Xian to inhabit the vessel once more and guide the people. The suit is exquisitely made and human like, able to wear additional armor as well as handle weapons and shields. The Jade queens command more priestly powers than their living counterparts.

#descr "Sinkiang is the beginning of the Jade Road, a vast trade route between the lands of the dragons and the great desert of the Jinnun. The Jinnun and their human servants have built a hidden kingdom and their caravans come every summer bringing frankincense and marvelous goods from the hidden land. While the vast majority of caravans are led by Sheiks, the Jinnun sometimes send well trained Sahirs on long and dangerous routes, such as the Jade Road. They do this not only for the extra protection, but also to sense hidden magic in trade items and spy the magical capabilities of distant kingdoms. The Sahir is a sorcerer of Sahar, the magic of the Jinnun. They can be recruited in the capital when the Caravan arrives. They believe in the Jinnun and their gods and will lower dominion wherever they go. They bring their own equipment and cost few resources though they demand considerably more pay then they would in their homeland. The Sahir have their own agenda. Sabotage, assassinations and worse are not unheard of should the opportunity present itself."

#brief "Sinkiang uses Jade to communicate with the paradise of their ancestors and manipulate the fortunes."
#descr "Between the lands of the Dragons where T'ien Ch'i lies and the great steps of Sauromatia lies the Jade Kingdom of Sinkiang. Jade is used to commune with the spirits of the ancestors inhabiting the paradise of immortals - Xian. Ancestors help guide the kingdom, change the fortunes and even participate in battles. Sinkiang is the beginning of the famed Jade Road that connects it to the Great Desert and the lands of the Jinnun. Every fall the caravans arrive with the riches of Ubar, and every spring they leave with the crafts of the Jade Kingdom. Many peoples live in the kingdom - Jade Amazons tribes that may be levied, nomadic steppe warriors, the conquered Yi, the Qin citizenry, and the noble Shang, leaders of the kingdom."
#summary "Race: Humans, Spirits of the Ancestors 
Military: Light and Medium Infantry, Primitive Crossbows and Chariots. Jade Amazon Mercenaries that fight single battles  
Magic: Water, Earth, Nature, Death, Astral. Minor Fire and Air
Priests: Powerful."
