These mutants are not ostracised or culled as they might be in the weak realms of civilised men but are instead treated with respect and honour. Those with the extreme mutations typically do not survive to adulthood but some join the marauders and unleash the blessing of their altered form upon the foe in a frenzied headlong rush.

#descr "Chaos Warriors are fighters of near unmatched prowess, possessing superhuman strength and durability combined with skills honed in countless battles and arms and armour forged in infernal fire. When a man joins the marauders and pledges his soul to Chaos he chooses a lifetime of bloody struggle with the promise of earthly reward, yet those who embark on the path of the Chaos Warrior cast aside such pursuits to seek greater truths and perhaps the chance of true immortality as near tireless killing machines. Warriors dedicated to Khorne are known for their brutality and offensive prowess in battle and are perhaps the most dangerous of all their kind.

The Chosen are savage and terrible to behold, their armoured festooned with gleaming Daemonic brass and skull trophies taken from particularly satisfying kills, their howling fury fully unleashed as they butcher ranks of foes in exultation of their master. While the Warriors of Khorne temper their rage with discipline even in battle, the Chosen are true berserkers who give their lives wholly to the expression of rage and bloodlust. It is said that the Chosen of Khorne will fight on despite horrendous wounds and in the face of impossible odds, for even should their sheer fury falter somehow, they would never willingly dishonour Khorne by taking a backward step. The Chosen have reached the end of their path, never destined to rise toward the ultimate goal of Daemonhood, but their souls will surely receive lavish attention from Khorne in death just as they have in life. The Chosen are sacred to the followers of the Blood God.

As with all Daemons of Chaos these monstrous cavalry are highly resistant to physical attacks but grow weaker outside the Dominion of their God.

#name "Chaos Ogre"
#descr "Ogres are large humanoid creatures known for their gluttony, strength, and love of violence. While they are typically quite resistant to both the warping taint of Chaos and the tempting whispers of the Dark Prince, they are naturally drawn to promises of excess and violence and so can often be found in the forces of Khorne. Even fairly small Marauder forces can occasionally find themselves benefitting from the presence of a handful of Ogres because these creatures are natural opportunists and recognise that in a smaller force they can bully their way to getting a larger share of the loot. Chaos Ogres have, despite their natural resistances, been changed by their exposure to Chaos and the attentions of the Ruinous Powers and are even stronger and more ferocious fighters than their former fellows in the Ogre Kingdoms.

Khorne treats his Hounds with rare indulgence and lavishes them with generous gifts, including the brass collars which grant them considerable magic resistance. Flesh Hounds are agents of Khorne's vengeance and known for tracking down those who raise their master's ire relentlessly across any terrain. In battle Flesh Hounds are typically unleashed to strike against vulnerable flanks or run down hated missile troops, delivering Khorne's judgement for their cowardice. As with all Daemons of Chaos these loping terrors are highly resistant to physical attacks but grow weaker outside the Dominion of their God. Flesh Hounds clearly bear the favour of Khorne and as such are sacred to the followers of the Blood God."

#name "Herald of Khorne"
#descr "Foremost amongst the ranks of the Bloodletters are the Heralds of Khorne. These serve not only as the commanders of the regiments of Bloodletters that make up much of Khorne's vast army but as takers of skulls that can duel and kill the greatest champions of those who stand against the Blood God. Much like the mortal Slaughterpriests the Heralds of Khorne are able to extend Khorne's blessings to his most favoured servants and see to the erection of temples honouring the Lord of Skulls. While the rank and file Bloodletter takes delight in wearing no encumbering armour and proving its sheer skill in battle, Heralds are far more disciplined and cold in their rage and seek only to carry out Khorne's wishes, so wear Daemonic plate. Khorne has a great hatred for those who would cower behind walls of stone rather than do battle and as such his Heralds have an innate understanding of how to break into besieged fortifications. As with all Daemons of Chaos these emissaries of wrath and conquest are highly resistant to physical attacks but grow weaker outside the Dominion of their God."

#descr "Most Marauder tribes will have one or two Shamans whose duty is to offer counsel to the Chieftain, interpret auguries to ensure successful raids, and lead the tribe in offering the proper observances to their patron God. Shamans tend to have only a little magical talent and rather than harnessing energy provided by the Ruinous Powers, they tap into the magic of their surroundings in the manner of hedge mages, witches, and other lesser mages. Shamans thus practice a different branch of magic from Sorcerers focused on veneration of the dead, the wilds, and the bitter cold of the polar lands. Shamans of Marauder tribes dedicated to Khorne in the guise of the Hound have a lower status than those of other tribes as Khorne is highly distrustful of magic users and carry a spear rather than a staff, for they are more willing warriors than others of their kind. They use magic of the wilds, frost, bone, and rock.

The Marauder tribes are well known for their raids by sea and Marauder Chieftains can command fleets of cramped but efficient longboats to bear Marauders and Warriors to battle, though they aren't nearly large enough to transport cavalry.

#descr "Even so called scholars of the Ruinous Powers are prone to mistake their natures as singular or unchangeable, believing Khorne is a create of slaughter, Slaanesh depravity, Nurgle decay, and Tzeentch sorcery. But in truth each of the Chaos Gods contains multitudes of aspects that contrast, compete, compliment, clash, and contradict each other in a constant impossible whirl of meaning. So it is that Khorne is the God of raging berserkers, keen tacticians, and honourable duelists all, but Khorne has aspect beyonds these too; the Blood God also favours smiths, the heat of the forge, and the discipline of the ascetic. The Disciples of Brass worship this last aspect of Khorne, a discipline and purity of form they see in Khorne's proclivity for gleaming brass. Though they train their bodies extensively the Disciples are not strictly warriors and though they are magically talented their use of the magic of Brass, of fire and earth and metal, could never be considered sorcery. They are monks of a kind, recruiting from members of the Marauder tribes who dream of an endless unspoiled realm of brass that lies within, and though they are not sacred to the followers of Khorne, they are treated with a wary respect.

Most who are chained in such a way die, thrashing and screaming until the very last, howling their endless rage at the sky, but a small handful manage to somehow control their bloodlust through strength of will. Those who survive this ordeal are selected by Khorne to be trained as Ragesmiths, the tireless smiths of daemonic arms and armour that worship Khorne's aspect as the lord of the fiery forge. Ragesmiths are truly gifted in the creation of magical items, letting Khorne's infinite knowledge of tools of slaughter and war flow through them and their great depth of rage guide their hammer on the Brass Anvil they were once bound to. Should a Ragesmith enter battle they will be unable to contain their rage and will immediately enter a berserk frenzy, hurling themselves into the enemy lines. Ragesmiths are recognised to be favoured by Khorne and are sacred to the followers of the Blood God.

These demagogues are known to drink the blood of the enemy spilled in battle and it is said that every drop that passes their lips is added to the great moat of blood surrounding Khorne's citadel of brass. Whether or not this is true, the consumption of this blood marks great physical changes in the Slaughterpriests, who tower over even hulking Chaos Warriors and whose muscle and bone have grown great and hard like stone and corded steel. Slaughterpriests are capable of performing incantations to deliver Khorne's gifts in battle and are known to perform blood rituals and seek out worthy sacrifices in the short times they spend away from the direct pursuit of war.

#name "Exiled One"
#descr "Skarbrand was once the mightiest and most favoured of Khorne's Bloodthirsters and the highest general amongst the Greater Daemons of the Blood God. It was Skarbrand who smashed the first palace of the youngest God Slaanesh, Skarbrand who slew the feared Lord of Change known as Tleth'krr, and Skarbrand who led the Eight Hosts of Murder to defeat the combined forces of all three rival Ruinous Powers. So did Skarbrand sit high in Khorne's esteem, and so did Skarbrand's pride grow until he foolishly tried to challenge the Blood God, suddenly striking his master with all his might. Khorne's great brass armour was barely scratched by the blow, but his rage was terrible to behold. Skarbrand was cast from the highest tower of the Brass Citadel and cursed with the total destruction of his once great mind and boundless ambition, instead becoming an unthinking avatar of rage doomed to gather skulls for Khorne in permanent exile. Skarbrand exists in a constant state of berserker rage and his very presence on the battlefield causes others to enter a similar state, as his madness and rage spreads. Skarbrand long ago discarded his whip in favour of a searing blade known as Carnage and in battle enters such a towering rage that he does not fly, instead charging headlong forward, wings forgotten. As a true exile Skarbrand is unlike other Bloodthirsters and does not grow weaker outside the Dominion of his master, nor will he be able to reform if slain in battle. Though Skarbrand is forever banished from Khorne's favour, his failed coup and subsequent rage is a stark reminder of the Blood God's power and he is both considered sacred and spreads the Dominion of the followers of Khorne."

#name "Bloodbeast"
#descr "Scylla Anfingrimm, known also as the Bloodbeast, was once a mighty Chaos Lord of Khorne, perhaps the greatest of his time. In his former life, he was nigh-invincible and unmatched in battle, having slain some of the fiercest beasts and armies in service to his God and raided the coastlines from frozen Norsca to exotic Ind. No other had so quickly climbed the ranks of the Blood God's esteem and many amongst his tribe, the vicious warriors of the Ironpelt, had boldly claimed that it would not be long until their ruler was visited by Khorne with the greatest gift of Daemonhood. In a sense, they were right. It was when Scyla had single-handedly slaughtered the bestial Gorgers of Undermountain, only the latest in a long litany of mighty and unimaginably violent deeds, that he was granted his final boon. But so passionate was Scylla for the gifts of the Blood God that this mutation, in addition to the multitudes he already possessed, proved too much for his mortal form and his transformation into a Chaos Spawn was complete. Khorne did not abandon Scylla, for the mortal had pleased the Blood God greatly, and so Scylla's mind was not entirely destroyed by the transformation and he was given a new, stable form of great physical might. Scylla became a giant, raging weapon of Khorne's will with strength and size beyond that of even the Daemon Princes. The Bloodbeast is so clearly blessed by Khorne that he spreads the dominion of his God as he rampages across the mortal realms."

#descr "Chaos Spawn are typically the result of one on the Path of the Champion displeasing or simply failing to sufficiently impress or amuse their patron God, but there are other ways by which they can be birthed from a magical laboratory to plague the world of mortals.

Bloodcrushers are in some ways similar to Chosen Knights and though the riders are far less armoured their Hellblade arguably makes up for this fact.

---- Contact Herald of Khorne

#newspell
#name "Contact Herald of Khorne"
#descr "This ritual contacts one the Heralds of Khorne, favoured commanders within the armies of the Blood God. These serve not only as the commanders of the regiments of Bloodletters that make up much of Khorne's vast army but as takers of skulls that can duel and kill the greatest champions of those who stand against the Blood God. Much like the mortal Slaughterpriests the Heralds of Khorne are able to extend Khorne's blessings to his most favoured servants and see to the erection of temples honouring the Lord of Skulls. While the rank and file Bloodletter takes delight in wearing no encumbering armour and proving its sheer skill in battle, Heralds are far more disciplined and cold in their rage and seek only to carry out Khorne's wishes, so wear Daemonic plate. Khorne has a great hatred for those who would cower behind walls of stone rather than do battle and as such his Heralds have an innate understanding of how to break into besieged fortifications. As with all Daemons of Chaos these emissaries of wrath and conquest are highly resistant to physical attacks but grow weaker outside the Dominion of their God."

---- Contact Daemon Prince

#newspell
#name "Contact Daemon Prince of Khorne"
#descr "This ritual contacts a Daemon Prince, a former Chaos Lord who has achieved the ultimate goal of immortality at the hand of their patron God. Daemon Princes of Khorne tend to hold a roughly humanoid shape, though typically with lower limbs more reminiscent than those of a Bloodletter or Bloodthrister, and greatly increased size as well as other alterations pleasing to the Blood God. Unlike the Daemon Princes of the other Ruinous Powers those of Khorne do not use magic at all, instead relying on their great physical strength and incredible martial prowess, as well as Daemonic weapons and armour gifted to them by Khorne. As representatives of Khorne's power and symbols of the rewards that can be gained in the service of the Blood God, Daemon Princes have priestly authority. While they are Daemons in form their past in the mortal world grants Daemon Princes the benefit of not becoming weaker outside the Dominion of their God, though like Greater Daemons they can still only reform their bodies if slain in this Dominion."

---- Contact Bloodthirster

#newspell
#name "Contact Bloodthirster"
#descr "This ritual contacts a Bloodthirster, a Greater Daemon of Khorne. Each Bloodthirster combines the mind of a master general, supernatural skill beyond the greatest champion, a towering and tireless physical form, and an implacable will to commit savagery and destruction in the name of the Blood God. Even in the Realms of Chaos the Bloodthirsters are feared, for in direct combat they are more than capable of slaying the Greater Daemons of the other Ruinous Powers, in some cases destroying the forms of many of these mighty foes. Khorne has a deep contempt for sorcery and Bloodthirsters use no magic save their daemonic armaments, though they are of Khorne's essence and may act as powerful priests in the Blood God's cause. Each is armed with a great burning axe to strike down single targets and a fiery whip with which to destroy ranks of massed enemies. As with all Daemons they are more powerful within the Dominion of their God and, as Greater Daemons, they are capable of reforming their body should they be slain in this Dominion."

#brief "Khorne is one of the four Ruinous Powers, the Gods of Chaos that draw strength from the darkest mortal emotions and drives. Khorne is known as the Blood God and Lord of Skulls, for their domain is violence, battle, rage, glory, and murder. The followers of Khorne are many and varied, but all seek reward from their patron God."

#descr "Khorne is one of the four Ruinous Powers, the Gods of Chaos that draw strength from the darkest mortal emotions and drives. Khorne is known as the Blood God and Lord of Skulls, for their domain is violence, battle, rage, glory, and murder. Each of the Ruinous Powers seeks dominion over the realms of mortals and advantage over their siblings, for to them all life is but a game. Greatest in number of the followers of Slaanesh are the Marauders, hardened human warriors from the tribes that surround the Chaos Wastes and are sometimes joined by Ogres or Trolls drawn by the prospect of great reward. Above the Marauders in status are the Chaos Warriors, elite fighters blessed with martial prowess and physical strength, and the Chosen Warriors who show Khorne's direct favour. Commanding the followers of Khorne are Champions, Exalted Heroes, and Chaos Lords, each of which seeks to some day ascend to immortality in the form of a Daemon Prince, though most on this path will die in battle or fail to meet Khorne's standards and be twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn. Finally the Daemons of Khorne are the most direct and horrifying servants of the Blood God, for they are the essence of Khorne given form and unleashed upon the world."

#summary "Race: Hardened humans with partial cold resistance, beasts of Chaos. Prefer Cold +2
Military: Exceptional heavy infantry and cavalry, medium infantry, few ranged weapons. Some troops and commanders can earn promotion, or damnation
Magic: Weak. Some blood, earth, fire, and death
Priests: Average. May perform blood sacrifice

---------------- WELCOME TO KHORNE -----------------

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! Khorne has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:

Path of the Warrior. Your Chaos Warriors and Knights can, through XP, earn the chance to be promoted to a Chosen. This won't trigger until the turn after the game announces their promotion and will only happen when they are outside of their home province (for technical reasons). They will then face the judgement of Khorne and may be either Chosen, Forsaken, or twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn.

Path of the Champion. Your military commanders can also earn promotion for a chance of a more powerful form, though unlike the troops it can trigger even in their home province. Aspiring Champions can become Exalted Heroes who can become Chaos Lords who can reach the final stage and become a Daemon Prince. At each stage of judgement they may fail Khorne and be turned into a mindless Chaos Spawn (killing them and giving you a Spawn as a troop), though the Spawn generated will tend to be more powerful than those you get from failed troop promotions. Additionally you may receive random rewards from Khorne, who is pleased by mortal ambition.

Red Harvest. Khorne rewards conquest with blood. Each province you control has a 10% chance multiplied by your candles present to grant 1d3 blood slaves. This chance is doubled if you have a temple in the province."
