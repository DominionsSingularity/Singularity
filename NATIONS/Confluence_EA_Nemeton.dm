#descr "The Druid of the Grove ventures deep into the heart of the forest in search of a fitting location to perform a most holy druidic ritual. Once in a place where the presence of many ancient spirits of the forest can be felt, the druid will prepare for the ritual and spend the next few days tattooing his entire body and covering it in magical, biding symbols. Once the placing of tattoos is complete, the druid will establish a communion with one of the spirits of the forest and be joined with both a chosen and willing spirit. The druid will take on the characteristics of his spirit animal which will be bound within the druid's tattoos. The tattoos will automatically flare to life any time the druid is in peril. Some druids have also been known to create amulets which allow them to temporarily take physical form of their spirit animals."
#details "After performing this ritual, the casting Druid of the Grove will be able to transform into either a Wolf, Bear, or a Boar in battle though the use of a an eponymous amulet of the same animal. The druid will inherit some of the traits of the animal chosen, signaling their chosen spirit.

#descr "The Druids of the Grove form an ancient order of priests of Nature who care for wildlife and perform ancient ceremonies to appease the spirits of the land. They are learned men of diverse fields of study, though all of them primarily study Nature magic. 
In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Ermorian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

#descr "The Druids of the Grove form an ancient order of priests of Nature who care for wildlife and perform ancient ceremonies to appease the spirits of the land. They are learned men of diverse fields of study, though all of them primarily study Nature magic. 
In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Ermorian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

Furthermore, the Sylvan Communion will make troop recruitment easier by reducing recruitment points of units. The spell lasts longer for every gem spent on the ritual.

#descr "Deep within the sacred groves of Nemeton dwell ancient and powerful spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. These spirits reside within strong, proud oak trees and are able to animate their old and rigid bark and branches, and stir them into action. As such, Sylvans are commonly mistaken for the ancient Treelords, and while they share certain similarities, they yet share no common link or ancestry.
The Sylvans use their mastery of Nature magic to create powerful spellweavings, shield the forests of Nemeton from prying eyes, and even create resources needed for weapons, quickly growing branches and trunks for woodworking and even sensing ore deposits close to the roots of the forests. In turn, the druids of Nemeton tend to, and protect the Sylvans. Their magic, however, is not without limit, and as soon as the guardians leave the forests, the glamour and enchantment granted to them will instantly shatter. Sylvans are capable of uprooting themselves in order to travel large distances, though not at an inconsiderable risk, as while uprooted, Sylvans lose some of their magic power, and grow weaker and weaker each month, until they eventually wither away and die. While in a forest, Sylvans are virtually undetectable, and hard to find even when not."

Though Keepers of the Grove are novice Water mages, some of them also devote a portion of their time to study Nature. While in forests, those Keepers with some knowledge of Nature will be able to draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain further insight into Nature magic. "

In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Ermorian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

#name "Nemeton"
#epithet "Hidden Groves"
#era 1
#descr "With Ermor's swift rise to power and prominence came the persecution of the numerous, scattered druidic circles. In the ensuing years of Ermor's aggressive military campaigns many druids died, but many also fled far and wide, until they discovered an ancient and hidden grove unlike any they had ever seen. There, the exiled druids were given shelter and protection by the primordial spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. Now, the druids of Nemeton and the Sylvans live in communion and safeguard each other against would-be intruders. 
The druids of Nemeton live in small communities centered around sacred Sylvan groves. They rarely build permanent settlements or fortifications as they have little use for them. Instead, they rely on powerful Sylvan enchantments to shelter them from prying eyes. The people of Nemeton are capable of moving unseen through forests, as the very forests guide and reinvigorate their every step. Even the weapons they carry strike with the power of the forest and entangle those struck by them."
#summary "Race: Human. Have no use of forts. Can only place additional settlements in forests, by moving Sylvans and creating new groves. 
Military: Light and medium infantry, light boar cavalry, archers. Troops become stealthy while in forest, and receive weapons that can entangle. 
Magic: Nature, Earth, Water, some Air. Mages gain +1 Nature magic while in forest.
Priests: Average."
#brief "Nemeton is a sanctuary to numerous druids, exiled and hunted down by Ermor. It is also the home of the Sylvans, ancient and powerful spirits of the forest."
