#copyspell "Blessing"
#name "The Power Within"
#descr "All mages of Edranor eventually learn how to tap into their wellspring of magic though a sundry of harsh and cruel methods that would be considered horrifying anywhere else in the world, especially when administered to children. Those who fail to acquire their powers through these singular means die in the process, and are generally considered better off dead. In the arduous years of training and torment, the mages of Edranor learn more than just the steep price of power, and how to transmute their emotions into magic. Through the knowledge painfully instilled in them, they also learn of a great universe outside the desert of Edranor, and how to form a bond and enter a communion with something far greater than themselves, and increase their powers even further."

#name "Create Greater Sigil of Malice"
#descr "The mages of Edranor have developed many complex and creative applications of their particular brand of magic. By imbuing magical gems with their intent and emotions, they are able to give form to complex weaves and create sigils of power, short-lived magical constructs capable of magic themselves. These weaves will function independently of their creator, and will continue to fulfil whatever purpose they've been giving for a brief time, until the reserves of emotion poured into them are spent.

A Sigil of Malice is a weave capable of unleashing considerable harm. Imbued with pure vitriol, the sigil projects its magic in a shower of acidic energy capable of eating away both flesh and metal."

Though it works after a fashion, the end result is less than desirable in just about most circumstances, for those who undergo it are purged of their very souls and left and become husks of their former selves, ones physically imposing and powerful, but husks none the less. In times of need the mages of Edranor will willingly sacrifice themselves to become the Sundered if there is no other way of prevailing."
#details "Each Sundered summoned will cost 10 population during the summoning. If there is no population present at the end of the summoning process, all the summoning will fail. Make sure to not leave the province completely depopulated to ensure successful summoning."

#descr "At times, great magical powers are used to imbue a sacrifice in order to force ascension. A willing mage is simultaneously imbued with magic and set ablaze with astral fires that ceaselessly continue to burn away at him during a month long ritual. This is rarely done however as the magical expenditure of such a ritual is often very costly, and the sheer agony of it beyond human comprehension and something very few even among the mages of Edranor can endure."

With their dying breath, the impaled mage will project the torment endured on the amplifier across the lands, and overwhelm an enemy army with sudden and excruciating torment. Though those affected suffer no real harm, the mental attack can still leaves horrible scars on their psyche."
#details "The army in the targeted province is attacked in a one round mock battle and a battle-wide effect is applied to the enemy force. An individual easy to negate MR roll for Weakness, Battle Fright, Mute, Feeble Minded, and Never Healing Wound is made against each unit.

This ritual will kill the casting mage in the process."

#descr "Though the Sacrificial Amplifier's primarily function is to act as a magnifying conduit meant to amplify the pain and suffering of those impaled upon it so they can harness all the more power from their strife, it can also serve as a crude magical focus capable of channeling the arcane energy of those impaled. If this energy is not directed either by the sacrifices themselves, or by the mages overseeing their torment, it will simply flow out into the aether, thereby increasing the ambient magic of a land. This ambient magic will eventually dissipate after a long time through a natural process which takes many months, but can be quite useful to the mages of Edranor even if short-lived. Mages will find it much easier to perform their spells and investigate the Arcane, and indeed the secrets of ascension in a land saturated with magic.

At all times are the mages of Edranor capable of forming a sympathetic link with the Mana Vortex, regardless of physical distance. When formed, the emotions of the mage in question will suddenly flare up, matching the volatility and sheer destructive desires of the Mana Vortex, and empowering their magical abilities."

Not only do they border a people so powerful that they could call down great pillars of powers, smite them down, and reduce their cities to rubbles and ashes as has happened with Ozidian in the past, but even their children are so fearless and brutal as to make grown men pause. Other realms do not see the mages of Edranor as victims of their past, trapped in a cycle of violence, but as perpetuators of brutality and unimaginable evil. It is for this reason that the people of Edranor continue to pursue power with religious zeal. Though Ozidian is long gone, the threats to their people have only multiplied as there seems to be no end of those who wish to see them enslaved once more, or annihilated. Fervent Warlocks are the battlemages tasked with protecting Edranor from would-be invaders. These mages can call down numerous bolts of arcane energy upon their enemies, and are well-suited to defending the desert of Edranor, where light armor is more common and practical as thus their strikes more impactful."

In fact, the mages of Edranor spend their entire lives training to draw upon such emotions and continue to hold a sufficient presence of mind to spellcast to the point of death. Since such emotions are not so easily spurred on at a moment's notice, most Edranorians rely on the sympathetic links they form with the Mana Vortex to be able to cast spell at all times.
Sometimes though, a careless mage can get overwhelmed by the link and draw too much from it to the point where they are no longer able to stop channeling and their magic starts to consume and burn them from the inside. Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, doing such a thing is a guaranteed death sentence.

A Diviner in his ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until he dies. Even if the Diviner doesn't die during battle, he will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

Indeed such people are sneered at, for if one had sufficient power, one wouldn't need to resort to primitive tools of war. With their particular brand of magic being dependent on emotions, primarily those of pain and anger, it is the female mages of Edranor who find it easier to wield magic - and thus power - being better suited to handle pain and having a much deeper well of emotions to draw upon. It is they who form the bulk of the Arcane Zealots, the most powerful mages of Edranor, and their mastery of the arcane is not easy matched.

In fact, the mages of Edranor spend their entire lives training to draw upon such emotions and continue to hold a sufficient presence of mind to spellcast to the point of death. Since such emotions are not so easily spurred on at a moment's notice, most Edranorians rely on the sympathetic links they form with the Mana Vortex to be able to cast spell at all times.
Sometimes though, a careless mage can get overwhelmed by the link and draw too much from it to the point where they are no longer able to stop channeling and their magic starts to consume and burn them from the inside. Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, doing such a thing is a guaranteed death sentence.

An Arcane Zealot in her ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until she dies. Even if the Arcane Zealot doesn't die during battle, she will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

	#descr "It is no secret than women are much better at magic in Edranor, and occupy almost all of the higher positions of power. None care for physical prowess or skill in arms in a realm where most everybody, including children, knows magic. Indeed such people are sneered at, for if one had sufficient power, one wouldn't need to resort to primitive tools of war. With their particular brand of magic being dependent on emotions, primarily those of pain and anger, it is the female mages of Edranor who find it easier to wield magic - and thus power - being better suited to handle pain and having a much deeper well of emotions to draw upon. It is they who form the bulk of the Arcane Zealots, the most powerful mages of Edranor, and their mastery of the arcane is not easy matched. It is their will that directs the people of Edranor, guided by the wisdom of the Diviners. "

#spr1 "./Confluence/EA_Edranor/Ascendant1.tga" 
#spr2 "./Confluence/EA_Edranor/Ascendant2.tga"
#descr "Though they are no longer of Edranor, some Ascendants still choose to linger for a time. Perhaps due to the bonds they once used to share with the people of this land, and that might still mean something to the ascended beings. Or perhaps out of simple curiosity, for they seem to retain little of their former personalities and sense of self. While the Ascendants are revered and their presence valued, they are also a source of constant frustration, as Ascendants are wholly alien in the way they perceive reality or how they communicate, and are often of little to no help when it comes to understanding ascension and how they achieved it. When asked to explain the process of ascension, they would answer in incomprehensible riddles that would spark frustrating philosophical debate that ultimately lead nowhere. 
'Evoke the spheres and consume their shinning lights.' they'd simply say, and considered the matter closed. Every question posed would receive a similarly incoherent response from every Ascendant, and every answer a new dozen questions.
Similarly to Ardent Mages, the Ascendants also appear as beings woven out of pure astral flames, but unlike them are in essence immortal, unfettered by their previous life and able to change their nebulous form to whatever is most suiting at the moment. Their understanding of the universe far surpasses that of other beings as death and dying are seemingly meaningless terms to them. Ascendants are magic incarnate and can simply reform themselves at will in any of the plains of existence when the need arises."

Chiseled to perfection, its gleaming surface made of gemstones seems to capture flames within it, giving it a radiant look and the appearance of flames flowing across its surface. The Gleaming Pyramids exudes such heat that the very air around it distorts, shimmers and burns the lungs of those who inhale it while the sand upon which it stands melts and turns to glass. Much like the other two Pyramids, the Gleaming Pyramid too has slowly started to develop a will of its own and powers to rival that of pretender gods. Endowed with the blazing fury of the Edranorians, the pyramid is capable of conjuring a vast prison of flame and enwebbing and subduing entire armies.

The Gleaming Pyramid will cast a battle-wide Prison of Fire on the enemy army at the start of each battle."

#descr "The people of Edranor have developed a certain level of artistry when it comes to carving out stone monuments, even if their purpose for doing so isn't merely artistic expression. Even those which are rough-hewn still hold a certain allure with their irregular contours and neatly inscribed sigils. Unlike those, the Three Pyramids are created as both works of art and sophisticated magical construct. 
The Obsidian Pyramid is carved out of smooth, iridescent obsidian and stores a powerful magical focus at its center. Designed to absorb both the souls and magic of countless mages, the Obsidian Pyramid has started to develop a will of its own over time, and is slowly growing to rival the powers of god-like entities. Endowed with the iron will of the Edranorians, the Obsidian Pyramid is able to dominate the minds of those around itself.

The Obsidian Pyramid will autocast an AoE 15 Communion Slave spell around itself at the beginning of each battle."

#descr "While the Sanguine Pyramid is striking in its own right, the sight of it is quite unsettling. Its dark surface is stained with a rich crimson hue which seems to perpetually and slowly flow down its glossy surface, giving it a fairly sinister and foreboding blood-drenched look. 
Filled with an insatiable craving for knowledge and power born of hatred, the Sanguine Pyramid will continue to gorge itself on the life-force of all those around it, regardless of allegiance, for it represents naught but wanton destruction and an infinite thirst for power. By gormandizing the life-force and magic of countless beings the Sanguine Pyramid has developed a will of its own and an aspiration to consume everything.

The Sanguine Pyramid will cast Bloodletting which will impact 10% of the battlefield each combat round with a MR negates easily roll."

#descr "There are certain rituals which are deemed too dangerous and extreme even by those who have no qualms about torturing and mutilating children, or impaling their brethren on specially constructed pain conduits which very slowly burn them alive. Despite all these obviously disturbing warning signs, there are still some few who undergo this rituals, and fewer still who come through alive. A Purified is a mage who has achieved a form of ascension through a horrifying and agonizing month-long ritual in which their mortal husk is literally burned away by astral fires. Purified are beings of pure arcane energy and as such are difficult to harm with mundane weapons. They are capable of shooting projectiles of pure astral energy at their enemies."

They've discovered a completely new and before unthought of form of magic. Countless little rituals, spells, incantations and constructs have been devised and created, and even significant progress into ascension has been made. All of this has been made significantly easier - though far from easy - by the existence of the Pillars of Knowledge. These monolithic slabs of stones have been overlain with countless intricate magical symbols interlaced is such a way to form a complex magical weave which significantly eases the study of the arcane by exuding a soothing aura on the mind and helping those near it focus on their research more easily."

As such Edranorians frequently lack the manpower needed for many otherwise common duties, such as guard or patrol duties. It is for this purpose that the Pillars of Vigils exist. These pillars are inscribed with sigils of warding which can sense those with ill-intent from leagues away, and focus powerful stellar rays on them capable of burning them to cinder."

The strange powers granted to this towering pillar by the mages of Edranor allow it to draw upon the magic of the Spheres and transmute it into a small amount of riches in the form of magic pearls and gold ore. These pillars are quite invaluable to the people of Edranor who do not produce much on their own, despite living in an ore rich region with already existing mining infrastructure. The gems are utilized for rituals and inquiries into ascension, while the gold is used to trade with those few and spread out villages willing to do so with the infamous people of Edranor.

A Pillar of Plenty will generate anywhere between one to three Astral gems, and ten to thirty gold per month. This effect will not be visible in either the nation's gem or gold income."

These ritual are the cornerstone on which the entire society of Edranor is built upon. They serve to cull the weak and powerless and help shape and expand the minds of those who remain. Such a cruel way of life can leave many marks on those who manage to survive childhood, for indeed many do not make it. Few are those among these hardened people of the desert who bear no mark of strife. It is for this reason that the Pillars of Endurance are erected and inscribed with magical symbols of healing, for without it many would remain crippled for life. A fate much less terrible in Edranor than in other places, but one best avoided. With time, a Pillar of Ednurance with heal even the most persistent of wound, and leave little trace of the abuse suffered during childhood, at least physically."

#descr "Edranorians have long since discovered that, with some effort, they can manifest their powers in a great vortex of swirling energy. However, as their primary source of power comes from deeply negative emotions such as hate, rage, and torment, it comes as no surprise that the manifestation of those powers is frightfully unstable, tempestuous, and prone to violent discharges of energy. Despite the inherent risks of creating a Mana Vortex and one becoming untethered, they are still the primary tool of the Edranorians, for they allow them to draw upon the vortex's endless well of emotions at all times so that they are never left powerless. In order to stabilize the volatile and fluctuating magic of a Mana Vortex and keep it from annihilating everything for leagues around itself in a violent discharge of energy, an Arcane Anchor is needed. Should the anchor be destroyed the Mana Vortex will flare up and explode before a new anchor can be created."

The spirit bound within the pillar is a master of the arcane arts and so tremendously powerful that it can pierce the veil of time and see into the future. The Arcana of Magic can be destroyed but not easily."

#selectnation 155
#name "EA Edranor"
#epithet "Pillars of Power"
#era 1
#descr "The harsh and sandy deserts of Edranor are home to a small group of magically-gifted people. The primary source of power of this race of mages comes not from any of the elements, or the forces of Life and Death, but rather from their emotions. Having survived a long history of slavery, strife and death, the powers that they had discovered - and that permitted them to survive and break the shackled that bound them - were those based on agony, torment, and unbridled rage born of loss and desperation. Tempered by a century of constant strife, first imposed upon them and then later self-inflicted, the people of Edranor have learned to harness their emotions to unlock their magical potential. From a very young age their children are taught to draw upon the emotions of pain and anger to fuel their magical abilities by being subjugated to excruciating and unthinkably cruel rituals. Many - of those who survive childhood - wear permanent scars which remind them of the true price of power, and those who die in the process serve as a grim reminder of what happens to those who do not posses sufficient power to protect themselves. 
Human sacrifice is common in Edranor, especially in times of dire need, though it differs in form to that practiced in most other lands. It is not the weak and the helpless who are preyed upon and then used in rituals against their will, for indeed there are no weak and helpless in Edranor. Instead, mages willingly impale themselves on devices which act both as torture devices and as amplifying conduits, and then use their own endless torment to power rituals they would otherwise be incapable of performing. Such a thing could never be accomplished with an unwilling sacrifice, for an iron will and a strong motivation are paramount for such a ritual. 
The people of Edranor worship only power, and neither temples nor priests hold any sway over their lands."
#summary "Race: Spell-casting humans. Commander can attain ascension by creating all five pillars in the same land and entering the Mana Vortex.
Military: A nation of mages who use spells instead of conventional weapons. Units can be trained and promoted in the national Mana Vortex site.
Magic: Fire, Astral, Blood. Can boost research, temporarily increase Magic scales, and place additional Mana Vortex sites. 
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is only spread through Pillar of Influence. Can recruit sacreds without temples."
#brief "A desert nation of spellcasters whose power comes from pain and suffering. They do not use conventional weapons but spells rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful and deadly, through few in number and easily killed."
