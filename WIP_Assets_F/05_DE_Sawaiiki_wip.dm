The White is the lord of abundance and agriculture, and keeps the peace. The Moon is the lord of war, and represents both the prosperity and horror that follows battles. The priests who follow them are trained to memorize special invocations to protect the warriors of Sawaiiki. However, their religious duties often prevent them researching effectively."

But seeing the natives below him, he fought with them before becoming captured himself. When challenged to a duel for honor, he easily defeated the Ali'i Aimoku, thinking that it would be the end for him regardless. However, both the Ali'i and Maka'aina praised him, for only by blood can mana be transferred. Now the Explorer has become deified as an aspect of the White, and leads the people of Sawaiiki onwards."
