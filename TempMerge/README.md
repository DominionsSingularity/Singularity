# Batch merging
Temporary batch file to merge text files into one.

Running "mergescript.bat" will copy text from files referenced in "enablednations.txt" and output it to "singularity.dm".
Files referenced in "enablednations.txt" have either a 0 or a 1 in front of them, 0 being disabled and 1 enabled.
New nations or files must be added to the list for them to be merged.
