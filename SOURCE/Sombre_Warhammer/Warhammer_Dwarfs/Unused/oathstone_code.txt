#descr "Some Thanes swear a sacred oath to defend their land and inscribe this oath to a large stone. In battle, the oathsworn Thane will stand upon this stone, gaining great strength and protection from the power of his oath. However, once oath is sworn, it cannot ever be taken back and the Thane will forever stay in the land he has sworn to guard. His oath also grants the blessing of wisdom, allowing him to tap into the divine might of the awakening god. Oathsworn thane is a glorious sight on he battlefield and will improve the morale of any nearby dwarf units. Oathsworn Thanes are skilled administrators and can collect taxes and improve province defence in their province."

#name "Oathsworn King"
#descr "Each major clan has a king. Clan Kings are not only great warriors and leaders, but also historians, knowing their ancestors by heart. They keep track of the grudges of the clan and constantly plan on ways to make them right. As a result, they can channel the power of their ancestors and curse foes for their sins against the dwarf race. Some Kings swear a sacred oath to defend their land and inscribe this oath to a large stone. In battle, the Oathsworn King will stand upon this stone, gaining great divine strength and protection from the power of his oath. Oathsworn King is a glorious sight on he battlefield and will improve the morale of his troops. Oathsworn Kings are noble rulers, improving province defence and collecting taxes in the province they guard."
