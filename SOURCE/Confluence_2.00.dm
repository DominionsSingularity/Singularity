-- ----------- READ ME!!! ----------- --

-- For those who wish to extract specific nations from the Confluence mod pack, follow these simple instructions.
-- To find where one nation begins, search [ERA] [NATION NAME] + NATION     -- EA EDRANOR NATION!
-- To find where one nation ends,   search [ERA] [NATION NAME] + NATION END -- EA EDRANOR NATION END! 
   
-- TODO list:

        -- Re-examine all events, cut out bloat / Remove event codes where possible/practical
        -- Check all req_ench spells and see about maybe replacing them with 10042 effect and event ID damage
        -- Check MA Musafir spells???
        -- Use the montag frequency thingy for where its possible. Miners come to mind, and Eljudnir summons
        -- Reduce even more delayed events cause they are retarded and they suck 
   		-- EA Elphame - check all the 10 million shape changing interactions and whether they are correct
		-- LA Anti, finish the update, or at least do the Gentry properly
		-- Black Hand Pirates norange, and skip weapon
		-- Wicked Hex change to smaller animals (or just forest animals) so it's not an enemy buff spell
		-- True Love's Kiss kinda fucked in certain cases, needs event transformations for certain outcomes?
		-- FREE IDS, 91, 719, 462, 4043

		-- New EA nation added, Khora - The Music of the Spheres
		-- EA Khora overview;		 
			-- Capital-centric nation. Cannot build forts, can only create them through expensive rituals, though the created forts are powerful and have 3 RP.
			-- Cannot make full use of enemy forts as non-Khora forts will still lack certain units.
			-- Can only recruit a total of 9 capital-only Demiurge mages. Further recruiting will yield nothing. However, all the Demiurge mages are unique and have distinct traits and magic paths that open more magic diversity. 
			-- Though there are only 9 Demiurge mages, those killed can be returning to the recruitment pool if a ritual is performed on the turn of their death, "Requiem". Not performing the ritual means permanently losing the option to recruit the slayed Demiurge again.
			-- Demiurge mages are extremely overpriced at the start of the game, however their price can be lowered by a ritual and then lowered further by the global "Music of the Spheres". Same discounts are granted to all Demiurge units.
			-- Though the Demiurge price can be lowered, at least one Demiurge mage must still be recruited at the high price in order to cast the discount ritual, which may also take some time to take effect.
			-- Despite being extremely capital reliant, Khora has capital only sacreds capped at 1 per turn, though the national global "Music of the Spheres" increases their cap to 2 per turn. The sacred are meant to be unviable early game as Sleep Aura is quite potent.
			-- Demiurge sacreds do not require a priest to accompany them as they can self bless, though they are restricted to size 6 commanders, as are all Demiurge units.
			-- Non-capital only sacred - Daimonion - are limited to a 1 per turn cap in other national forts, as opposed to the 3 per turn cap in the capital. 
			-- Recruiting Twilight Daemons will randomly yield a Twilight Daemon with a lute and the ability to stun nearby units at a 1 in 4 or 5 rate.
			-- Twilight Daemons are recruitable in forest provinces.
			-- Daemon Savages are recruitable in mountain and border mountain provinces.
			-- Twilight Troubadours have two shapes, a lute and a battle shape. In their lute shape they cast a Charm one-battle-spell at the beginning, making them more capable assassins than they seem. 
			-- Twilight Troubadours can assassinate in lute shape then be set to change shapes mid battle via battle script in order to cast the single round of Charm before taking up a shield and a sword again.
			-- Powerfull fort defenders, including a Harp that puts enemy troops to sleep from a distance.
			-- A plethora of national items and spells.
			-- There are a number of magical lutes that can be constructed and given to Demiurge commanders, Deamon or Twilight Lutists.
			-- Khora can manipulate scales through national items to a good degree. Various harp items can increase Order, Luck, Death, Growth, and slowly erase all existing scales and turn them to neutral.
			-- Powerful sacred summons, though hard to mass.
			-- A plethora of national spells along with a good number of battle spells some of which grant powerful buffs to friendly units.
			-- Demiurge mages can cast "Aria" and "Duet" ritual spells that grant good events in the province they are cast in, or surrounding provinces.
			-- National spell - "Hymn of Ascension'' - that can shatter a targeted enemy throne after a number of consecutive casts.
			-- "Divine Symphony" game ending global spells that have the potential to erase all enemy dominion worldwide.

Being wholly uncivilized, savage daemons are prone to fits of extreme aggression, rage, and impulsiveness. They are large, wild, beastly beings with horns and unkempt hair. The very nature of the savage daemons is driven by pure instinct, and they respond directly and immediately to basic urges, needs, and desires. They are primitive and irrational creatures. The secrets of metalworking, let alone of other fine arts, still elude them and as such most savage daemons use simple wooden clubs, rocks, or anything else at hand while fulfilling their short-term and selfish ambitions. Still, with the arrival of the Demiurges the small and widely spread daemonic tribes have slowly started to rise out of darkness and ignorance, adopting the strange concepts brought by the gods."

These daemons belong to neither of the worlds they've left behind, rejected by their savage brethren whom they abandoned for Khora and who now deem them corrupted by the new gods, but also snubbed by their civilized brethren who yet remain in Khora. Twice damned for abandoning their fellows, these daemons now live in relative seclusion, ever keeping to the shadows and out of sight.

Much like the rest of the civilized daemons, Twilight Daemons too have shed much of their aggression, rage, and some of their brutish and unkempt stature, but have also learnt to stay hidden and out of sight.
Twilight Daemons will often sing and play their harps as they go into battle, both rallying and inspiring their allies and befuddling their foes. Those enemies who hear the enchanting twilight spellsongs will find themselves smitten and bewitched for a moment at the impossibility of hearing such divine music coming from profane creatures such as deamons.

#descr "Despite the nigh inexhaustible wells of knowledge offered to them, many of the few daemons who even choose to embrace the Demiurges and their teachings eventually grow too restless in Khora and choose to set back out into the wilderness again, taking with them the many secrets of the Demiurges, but perhaps more importantly their songs. These daemons belong to neither of the worlds they've left behind, rejected by their savage brethren whom they abandoned for Khora and who now deem them corrupted by the new gods, but also snubbed by their civilized brethren who yet remain in Khora. Twice damned for abandoning their fellows, these daemons now live in relative seclusion, ever keeping to the shadows and out of sight. During bright and cloudless nights they will venture out and gather in forest glades they have come to call their own, and sing the songs they have learned under the tutelage of the Demiurges in the long years spent in Khora, and others yet they have since composed themselves in their self-inflicted exile. Much like the rest of the civilized daemons, Twilight Daemons too have shed much of their aggression, rage, and some of their brutish and unkempt stature, but have also learnt to stay hidden and out of sight.
Twilight Daemons will often sing and play their harps as they go into battle, both rallying and inspiring their allies and befuddling their foes. Those enemies who hear the enchanting twilight spellsongs will find themselves smitten and bewitched for a moment at the impossibility of hearing such divine music coming from profane creatures such as deamons."

#descr "Very little that comes from the formless interval of Khora can be accused of being mundane and prosaic. This is especially true of the Demiurge Songstresses who have learnt to marry the art of war with the enchanting spell-songs of Khora in a rather singular style. The battle bards of Khora carry with them giant harps with sturdy cords that double as shields. These towering war maidens have mastered the impossible art of plucking away at their harps and singing their impossible songs all the while fighting many opponents in a flurry of motion of unimaginable precision and grace unrivaled. Yet to see these demigods in action and to hear their powerful spellsong and the concordant notes of their harps is to believe the impossibility of it, and fall under their enchanting influence.

Demiurge Songstresses recruitment price can be lowered through the First Song ritual, first to 200 gold, then to 100 gold, as well as through the Music of the Spheres ritual which also increases their recruitment limit by +1 and lowers the recruitment price to 75 gold. Their upkeep price remains at 300 however."

#descr "Very little that comes from the formless interval of Khora can be accused of being mundane and prosaic. This is especially true of the Demiurge Songstresses who have learnt to marry the art of war with the enchanting spell-songs of Khora in a rather singular style. The battle bards of Khora carry with them giant harps with sturdy cords that double as shields. These towering war maidens have mastered the impossible art of plucking away at their harps and singing their impossible songs all the while fighting many opponents in a flurry of motion of unimaginable precision and grace unrivaled. Yet to see these demigods in action and to hear their powerful spellsong and the concordant notes of their harps is to believe the impossibility of it, and fall under their enchanting influence.

Demiurge Songstresses recruitment price can be lowered through the First Song ritual, first to 200 gold, then to 100 gold, as well as through the Music of the Spheres ritual which also increases their recruitment limit by +1 and lowers the recruitment price to 75 gold. Their upkeep price remains at 300 however."

These individuals preside over all things daemonic and lead their people, a difficult and often taxing task for even the deamons of Khora, inhibited and restrained as they are compared to their savage brethren, can prove to be exceptionally contrary and difficult to lead and battle."

Those daemons who were ultimately overcome by their impulsive nature and the need to be free of any agents or influence are damned to walk a very precarious line between those they have twice rejected. Such daemons belong to the shadows and the darkest recesses of the land and they are called the daemons of the twilight. It is the Twilight Lords who preside over all matters relating to the daemons of the twilight, and navigate their kin through the dangerous wilds. Even in this the Demiurges have a purpose, for as much as the role of the daemons is to bridge the mortal sphere and the divine, it is the role of the twilight daemons to bridge the savages and Khora. Though daemons of the twilight mostly keep to themselves, their very existence among the savage tribes spreads the influence of the Demiurges; their art, knowledge, and wisdom."

They signify what is to come, the awakening of the daemonic tribes from their long, dream-like fugue and their inevitable ascension over the mortal plane. Belonging to neither the mortal nor the divine, but rather both, the Daimonions act as the conduits between the worlds and thus command influence over both spheres. Few are those whose inner-daemon has been fully awakened and their service is thus all the more valuable."

#descr "The Demiurges are god-like beings responsible for fashioning and maintaining the physical realms. Though shapers of creation itself, the Demiurges are not uncreated beings but are rather a product of something greater themselves. Outside of the material substratum known as Khora, the Demiurges take the physical appearance of imposing, centaur-like beings of tremendous might, however inside their formless interval the Demiurges are not bound by the constraints of the material universe and can turn formless, into voices, or even just ideas. Demiurge Lords preside over all of the mundane aspects of Khora so that the Nine can better focus on shaping the world through their art, unburdened by trivialities. Often, the Demiurge Lords will even lead the daemons of Khora into combat should the need arise, for they are possessed of an uncanny ability to command the unruly and whimsical daemons, a task seldom easy even for the most capable of the daemon lords.

Demiurge Lord's recruitment price can be lowered to 120 gold and their recruitment price halved through the Music of the Spheres ritual."

From their songs was the universe spun into being and all within it, and when the Music of the Sphere is ended, so will the universe. There are but nine primordial Demiurges in existence. Though after countless eons their descendants may now number many, they are nowhere as powerful as the Nine. Even so, their songs have been known to give birth to wondrous things. The Nine are eternal beings. Stemming from the formless interval, they are immaterial for they have no need of physical shapes. However, in the mortal realms the Nine take the shapes of towering and majestic centaur-like beings. They are immortal and completely unkillable by any means even in their restrained physical vessels, though they can still be banished from the material realm back to their formless interval.

The recruitment price of The Nine can first be lowered to 750 gold, then 600 gold through the First Song ritual, and then further lowered to 450 gold by the Music of the Spheres ritual which also halves their recruitment price. When killed in battle, the Nine will retain any experience and traits gained, and will return to the recruitment pool, assuming Requiem has been cast on same turn battle reports of their deaths are received. Should Requiem not be cast, the slayed Demiurge will permanently be removed from the recruitment pool. A single Requiem will suffice for any number of Demiurges lost, though it must be cast as soon as one is killed."

However, unlike other Demiurges, they spend considerable time in the material universe. It is said that all the stars in all the skies were shaped by the Sagittarians, for their song is prophetic and they see all that is, was, and ever will be, and thus know the universe and all the stars are theirs to shape. Somewhat more accustomed to this physical form of existence, the Sagittarians are even more imposing than the rest of the Demiurges, including the Nine. Being what they are, the song yet to be sung, Sagittarians have perfect vision and perfect foresight, and thus their arrows never fail to hit their mark, even if it might sometimes seem that way. Such an existence is surely an onerous one, for the Sagittarians are ultimately locked in their destinies and deprived of free will and choice, for all their great deeds have already come to pass, even though they are yet to undertake them."

As such the part of Khora that touches the Terrestrial sphere is filled with numerous magical instruments enchanted to play their tunes endlessly, and soothe the burden of the Demiurges until their grand designs in the material universe are complete."

	#descr "In the formless interval the Demiurges exist as an endless symphony that plays out throughout the spheres. To say that music is omnipresent in the material substratum would be to fundamentally misunderstand that the Demiurges are music itself. When confined to their corporeal forms in the Terrestrial sphere, the Demiurges suffer greatly, for to be deprived of music for even an instant can be physically painful to the creator gods. As such the part of Khora that touches the Terrestrial sphere is filled with numerous magical instruments enchanted to play their tunes endlessly, and soothe the burden of the Demiurges until their grand designs in the material universe are complete."

When performed, this great composition will play out through the spheres and exert the influence of the Nine."
#details "This ritual can only be cast by the nine Demiurges. In order for it to have effect it needs to be cast by all nine Demiurges simultaneously from nine different provinces.
Once cast, Divine Symphony will lower the dominion score of every province on the map by 1, except for Khora's provinces which will receive a dominion increase of 1. Furthermore, all neutral dominion provinces will shift to Khora's dominion."

#newspell
#name "Requiem" -- Mass for the Dead / Elegy
#descr "Through the Nine are quite immortal perhaps in all the realm but their own formless interval, their physical forms can still be vanquished and banished back to their material substratum known as Khora. When a Demiurge is slayed, it may take many years, or perhaps even centuries for their song to reach the material spheres again. Unlike the lesser Demiurges who may be freely ushered into the world with a potent enough spellsong, the songs of the Nine are too great to be carried by anyone other than themselves. Once their song has passed from the material realm, it cannot be freely summoned back by any means. However, when a Demiurge dies, their song, their essence, can be captured before it passes through the material realms by performing a Requiem. Such a complex act is not easily done, and holds a number of caveats which further complicate the matter. None but the Nine are powerful enough to perform such a spellsong, and there is but a brief window of opportunity to perform it before the song of the slayed Demiurge passes out of reach."
#details "When cast on the turn any of the nine Demiurges die, it will return the killed ones to the recruitment pool and enable them to be recruited once again. As Demiurges are unique commanders they will carry over any experience, empowerments, or other traits acquired. If the province is lost during the turn Requiem is cast, it will result in a failed ritual and the dead Demiurges will remain dead for good."

#name "Khora"
#epithet "The Music of the Spheres"
#era 1
#descr "Khora is a formless interval. It is an otherworldly place that exists outside of the physical universe, and none of the beings inhabiting it have either shape nor location, much like the realm itself. Khora is sometimes also referred to as the non-realm of creation. It represents the unintelligible substratum of the material universe and it is the realm from which all other realms were given shape, or rather sung into being by the Demiurges, the primordial gods of this realm, and the shapers of the material universe. In the formless realm the Demiurges can turn amorphous, into voices, or ideas, though what they are is the song that echoes across the universe. Their song brings with it creation, and it is said that when their grand symphony is finally played out across the spheres, the universe will come to an end.
Though Khora is a formless plane without a location, it is connected to the material universe at certain junctions. One such junction, whether by design or happenstance, is in the land of the Daemons, savage and irrational beings of great brutality - but also vast potential - to whom the Demiurges have gradually started revealing the secrets of the cosmos and teaching them the music of the spheres."
#summary "Race: Demiurges and Daemons. Cannot construct national forts, can only create them through rituals. 
Military: Powerful capital only sacreds, limited recruit everywhere sacreds, light infantry, heavy infantry, archers, stealthy units, giant cavalry. 
Magic: Water, Astral, Nature, rare Fire and Earth.
Priests: Powerful."
#brief "Khora is a land of primordial and timeless creator-gods named the Demiurges and of numerous Daemonic tribes, as of yet an uncivilized and brutish people, but one for whom the Demiurges foresee greatness."

#copyspell "Blessing"
#name "The Power Within"
#descr "All mages of Edranor eventually learn how to tap into their wellspring of magic though a sundry of harsh and cruel methods that would be considered horrifying anywhere else in the world, especially when administered to children. Those who fail to acquire their powers through these singular means die in the process, and are generally considered better off dead. In the arduous years of training and torment, the mages of Edranor learn more than just the steep price of power, and how to transmute their emotions into magic. Through the knowledge painfully instilled in them, they also learn of a great universe outside the desert of Edranor, and how to form a bond and enter a communion with something far greater than themselves, and increase their powers even further."

#descr "Unlike most mages who draw their power from one of the magical spheres or the elements, the source of power of the Edranorian mages is a bit more unconventional and is based on negative emotions, primarily those of pain and anger. It is said that the first people to exhibit these peculiar powers came from the infamous slave mines of Ozidian of the eponymous kingdom, where as many as a third of the slaves would perish yearly due to hardship of the mines, and the abuse they suffers at the hands of the taskmasters. Eventually, the kingdom built upon brutality was destroyed by it, and brick by brick its existence erased from history by those who would come to call themselves Edranorians, the people of hardship in the old tongue of Ozidian. Those who live today are retold the horrors of Ozidian to imprint upon them what happens to those who are weak and who cannot endure. From a very tender age the people of Edranor are conditioned to withstands unconscionable brutality and then through sheer force of willpower use it to channel powerful magic. Using emotions to as a source of magic is exceptionally hard, and quite dangerous. Most mages spend their years perfecting but a single spell, and it can take a lifetime to fully master even the single one. Burning Warlocks are mages capable of binding and immobilize their enemies by conjuring a prison made of flames around them. Those more skilled and adept can make the prison impossible to resist, or even cast it around numerous enemies at once."

Having the mental fortitude to weave complex spell or rituals both while harnessing emotions such as pain and rage, while also containing the adverse effect they impose is no small feat. In fact, the mages of Edranor spend their entire lives training to draw upon such emotions and continue to hold a sufficient presence of mind to spellcast to the point of death. Since such emotions are not so easily spurred on at a moment's notice, most Edranorians rely on the sympathetic links they form with the Mana Vortex to be able to cast spell at all times.
Sometimes though, a careless mage can get overwhelmed by the link and draw too much from it to the point where they are no longer able to stop channeling and their magic starts to consume and burn them from the inside. Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, doing such a thing is a guaranteed death sentence.

A Diviner in his ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until he dies. Even if the Diviner doesn't die during battle, he will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

Though those who fall into this trapping will for a brief time experience a profound surge of power, doing such a thing is a guaranteed death sentence.

A Spellbinder in his ardent form will gain +1 to all magic paths during battle, but will take 1AN dmg capped each combat round until he dies. Even if the Spellbinder doesn't die during battle, he will still be killed as soon as it ends. Upon death, the mage will explode in an AoE 1 effect."

Though their magic abilities are modest compared to some of the senior mages of Edranor, they are still sufficiently potent to have earned them an honored position in the hierarchy of power even at their young age."

Having the mental fortitude to weave complex spell or rituals both while harnessing emotions such as pain and rage, while also containing the adverse effect they impose is no small feat.

#name "Ascendant"
#spr1 "./Confluence/EA_Edranor/Ascendant1.tga" 
#spr2 "./Confluence/EA_Edranor/Ascendant2.tga"
#descr "Though they are no longer of Edranor, some Ascendants still choose to linger for a time. Perhaps due to the bonds they once used to share with the people of this land, and that might still mean something to the ascended beings. Or perhaps out of simple curiosity, for they seem to retain little of their former personalities and sense of self. While the Ascendants are revered and their presence valued, they are also a source of constant frustration, as Ascendants are wholly alien in the way they perceive reality or how they communicate, and are often of little to no help when it comes to understanding ascension and how they achieved it. When asked to explain the process of ascension, they would answer in incomprehensible riddles that would spark frustrating philosophical debate that ultimately lead nowhere. 
'Evoke the spheres and consume their shinning lights.' they'd simply say, and considered the matter closed. Every question posed would receive a similarly incoherent response from every Ascendant, and every answer a new dozen questions.
Similarly to Ardent Mages, the Ascendants also appear as beings woven out of pure astral flames, but unlike them are in essence immortal, unfettered by their previous life and able to change their nebulous form to whatever is most suiting at the moment. Their understanding of the universe far surpasses that of other beings as death and dying are seemingly meaningless terms to them. Ascendants are magic incarnate and can simply reform themselves at will in any of the plains of existence when the need arises."

#descr "Though each of the Three Pyramids of Edranor are a marvel to behold, the Gleaming Pyramid is certainly the most awe-inspiring, assuming one could even gaze at it long enough to fully take in and appreciate its beauty without going blind, a daunting act nearly worth the risk. Chiseled to perfection, its gleaming surface made of gemstones seems to capture flames within it, giving it a radiant look and the appearance of flames flowing across its surface. The Gleaming Pyramids exudes such heat that the very air around it distorts, shimmers and burns the lungs of those who inhale it while the sand upon which it stands melts and turns to glass. Much like the other two Pyramids, the Gleaming Pyramid too has slowly started to develop a will of its own and powers to rival that of pretender gods. Endowed with the blazing fury of the Edranorians, the pyramid is capable of conjuring a vast prison of flame and enwebbing and subduing entire armies.

The Gleaming Pyramid will cast a battle-wide Prison of Fire on the enemy army at the start of each battle."

#descr "The people of Edranor have developed a certain level of artistry when it comes to carving out stone monuments, even if their purpose for doing so isn't merely artistic expression. Even those which are rough-hewn still hold a certain allure with their irregular contours and neatly inscribed sigils. Unlike those, the Three Pyramids are created as both works of art and sophisticated magical construct. 
The Obsidian Pyramid is carved out of smooth, iridescent obsidian and stores a powerful magical focus at its center. Designed to absorb both the souls and magic of countless mages, the Obsidian Pyramid has started to develop a will of its own over time, and is slowly growing to rival the powers of god-like entities. Endowed with the iron will of the Edranorians, the Obsidian Pyramid is able to dominate the minds of those around itself.

The Obsidian Pyramid will autocast an AoE 15 Communion Slave spell around itself at the beginning of each battle."

Filled with an insatiable craving for knowledge and power born of hatred, the Sanguine Pyramid will continue to gorge itself on the life-force of all those around it, regardless of allegiance, for it represents naught but wanton destruction and an infinite thirst for power. By gormandizing the life-force and magic of countless beings the Sanguine Pyramid has developed a will of its own and an aspiration to consume everything.

The Sanguine Pyramid will cast Bloodletting which will impact 10% of the battlefield each combat round with a MR negates easily roll."

They've discovered a completely new and before unthought of form of magic. Countless little rituals, spells, incantations and constructs have been devised and created, and even significant progress into ascension has been made. All of this has been made significantly easier - though far from easy - by the existence of the Pillars of Knowledge. These monolithic slabs of stones have been overlain with countless intricate magical symbols interlaced is such a way to form a complex magical weave which significantly eases the study of the arcane by exuding a soothing aura on the mind and helping those near it focus on their research more easily."

Of those who live there, most are occupied with unlocking their magical abilities or the study of the arcane. As such Edranorians frequently lack the manpower needed for many otherwise common duties, such as guard or patrol duties. It is for this purpose that the Pillars of Vigils exist. These pillars are inscribed with sigils of warding which can sense those with ill-intent from leagues away, and focus powerful stellar rays on them capable of burning them to cinder."

The strange powers granted to this towering pillar by the mages of Edranor allow it to draw upon the magic of the Spheres and transmute it into a small amount of riches in the form of magic pearls and gold ore. These pillars are quite invaluable to the people of Edranor who do not produce much on their own, despite living in an ore rich region with already existing mining infrastructure. The gems are utilized for rituals and inquiries into ascension, while the gold is used to trade with those few and spread out villages willing to do so with the infamous people of Edranor.

A Pillar of Plenty will generate anywhere between one to three Astral gems, and ten to thirty gold per month. This effect will not be visible in either the nation's gem or gold income."

These ritual are the cornerstone on which the entire society of Edranor is built upon. They serve to cull the weak and powerless and help shape and expand the minds of those who remain. Such a cruel way of life can leave many marks on those who manage to survive childhood, for indeed many do not make it. Few are those among these hardened people of the desert who bear no mark of strife. It is for this reason that the Pillars of Endurance are erected and inscribed with magical symbols of healing, for without it many would remain crippled for life. A fate much less terrible in Edranor than in other places, but one best avoided. With time, a Pillar of Ednurance with heal even the most persistent of wound, and leave little trace of the abuse suffered during childhood, at least physically."

#descr "Edranorians have long since discovered that, with some effort, they can manifest their powers in a great vortex of swirling energy. However, as their primary source of power comes from deeply negative emotions such as hate, rage, and torment, it comes as no surprise that the manifestation of those powers is frightfully unstable, tempestuous, and prone to violent discharges of energy. Despite the inherent risks of creating a Mana Vortex and one becoming untethered, they are still the primary tool of the Edranorians, for they allow them to draw upon the vortex's endless well of emotions at all times so that they are never left powerless. In order to stabilize the volatile and fluctuating magic of a Mana Vortex and keep it from annihilating everything for leagues around itself in a violent discharge of energy, an Arcane Anchor is needed. Should the anchor be destroyed the Mana Vortex will flare up and explode before a new anchor can be created."

#selectnation 155
#name "Edranor"
#epithet "Pillars of Power"
#era 1
#descr "The harsh and sandy deserts of Edranor are home to a small group of magically-gifted people. The primary source of power of this race of mages comes not from any of the elements, or the forces of Life and Death, but rather from their emotions. Having survived a long history of slavery, strife and death, the powers that they had discovered - and that permitted them to survive and break the shackled that bound them - were those based on agony, torment, and unbridled rage born of loss and desperation. Tempered by a century of constant strife, first imposed upon them and then later self-inflicted, the people of Edranor have learned to harness their emotions to unlock their magical potential. From a very young age their children are taught to draw upon the emotions of pain and anger to fuel their magical abilities by being subjugated to excruciating and unthinkably cruel rituals. Many - of those who survive childhood - wear permanent scars which remind them of the true price of power, and those who die in the process serve as a grim reminder of what happens to those who do not posses sufficient power to protect themselves. 
Human sacrifice is common in Edranor, especially in times of dire need, though it differs in form to that practiced in most other lands. It is not the weak and the helpless who are preyed upon and then used in rituals against their will, for indeed there are no weak and helpless in Edranor. Instead, mages willingly impale themselves on devices which act both as torture devices and as amplifying conduits, and then use their own endless torment to power rituals they would otherwise be incapable of performing. Such a thing could never be accomplished with an unwilling sacrifice, for an iron will and a strong motivation are paramount for such a ritual. 
The people of Edranor worship only power, and neither temples nor priests hold any sway over their lands."
#summary "Race: Spell-casting humans. Commander can attain ascension by creating all five pillars in the same land and entering the Mana Vortex.
Military: A nation of mages who use spells instead of conventional weapons. Units can be trained and promoted in the national Mana Vortex site.
Magic: Fire, Astral, Blood. Can boost research, temporarily increase Magic scales, and place additional Mana Vortex sites. 
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is only spread through Pillar of Influence. Can recruit sacreds without temples."
#brief "A desert nation of spellcasters whose power comes from pain and suffering. They do not use conventional weapons but spells rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful and deadly, through few in number and easily killed."

Many have been known to die in the coming hours after being whipped with the Cat from profuse bleeding and those that survive are left with grotesque reminders of their insubordination. This cruel whip is a symbol of authority and as such any pirate that sees it in action will be made more willing to follow command."

Despite knowing next to nothing of her origin, many believe her to have been born of a particularly powerful sea witch, for the only explanation to her intoxicating charm and good fortune in her enterprises may only be attributed to her having a hint of magic, or perhaps a guardian angel who watches over her and sends favorable winds her way. Many a pirate says that any time Miss Fortune sets sail from Tortuga hard winds push her sails at impossible speeds all the way to the shores of her desire, as if guided by magic. 
Miss Fortune's tricorne hat is her good luck charm and she never sails without it."

#newspell
#name "Black Sails"
#descr "A mark is placed upon a distant shore. Pirates will flock to this shore seemingly attracted to it like a beacon. Black sails will become an ever present sight on the horizon and pirate raids, from pirates both living and dead, will become a regular occurrence. Once the mark has been placed upon a shore it cannot be removed until it runs its course."
#details "This ritual will enable a series of negative events to befall the targeted province. It can only be cast from a shore, and though it can target any terrain, it will have no effect unless a coastal province is targeted with it. Once the spell is cast no subsequent placing of domes will prevent the curse from taking effect until it runs its course."

    #descr "All pirates know two things, that there are places better left alone and there are fates much worse than death, eternal damnation being one of them. Sightings of rotten and long-since sunken pirate ships navigated by dead and infamous pirate kings and their notorious crews are common tales in pirate taverns of Tortuga. Some believe these dead sailors to be the most notorious of all pirate crews who refused to lay to rest and abandon their deleterious way of life even in death, while others yet think them crews cursed by the Sea Crones or even the Sea Goddess herself to sail the seas until such time the seas dry up. Whatever the case may be, these risen pirates and their terrible captains strike fear into the hearts of all men. Few who cross such monsters survive to tell tales of bombs filled with eternal damnation killing their loved ones"

The Shantymen improve the morale of all sailors on long voyages and sing songs of merriment that help pass the time. In battles however, the Shantymen sing completely different types of songs that reverberate and hum with power; songs spoken through dry and salty mouths and in strange words. Those pirates who hear these spell-songs find themselves empowered by them. There are many types of sea shanties and many strange languages they are sung in, and none know them all. Each Shantyman typically only has an affinity for a single type of shanties and thus all Shantymen specialize those types they show talent for. The Shantyman is the second-most crucial member of a ship's crew, after the captain, and it is said that a good Shantyman is worth at least ten extra hands in battle."

Their meddling has led to no small number of assassinations, wars, and various other political intrigues. Consequently, Feyseers are not fully trusted by the pirate community, as fundamental as they are to the society.

It is their strong and ruthless personalities as well as their exceptional fighting skills that keep them at the top of the pirate hierarchy for many years, until they are eventually replaced by more cunning and ambitious pirates. Pirate Kings fully enjoy the privileges of their position and gladly indulge in the company of virgins they've successively 'lured' into their beds. Through their reputations they command great respect from their underlings and fill their enemies with dread. Bards and storytellers have made fortunes singing songs and telling tales of Pirate Kings who've single-handedly looted entire settlements, getting away with barely a scratch, overfilled coffers and the local Lord's daughters. Though Pirate Kings care little for religious pomp and ceremony, it is not uncommon that at times, when winds are unfavorable, they will offer human sacrifices to appease the Sea. The ships of Pirate Kings are naturally the largest and best ships in Tortuga. These wooden monstrosities often carry dozens of cannons and various other armaments."

#descr "The Ghost Ship is a thing of myth and legend in Tortuga, and many other ports around the world. It is a favored tale often told in places frequented by sailors across the Seven Seas. Despite many accounts and fanciful stories told about it over the long years, few are those who actually believe it to be real, for few are those who ever survive to tell the tale of the Ghost Ship and its damned crew. But every so often lone survivor appear to once again stoke interest and tell outlandish tales of a bulking monstrosity of a ship suddenly appearing in the harbor, silently gliding above the cold dark waters, shimmering in the night. Though the tales of new sightings are rare and far between, they often sound eerily similar and talk of a cursed ship that always appears during the darkest of nights, with little to no moonlight, and heavy overcast skies, always accompanied by thick, obscuring mists, and the eventual incredulous wails of those who encounter it. The grave silence of its arrival is rarely broken by alarm bells, but rather the deafening sound of its cannon barrage. The Ghost Ship is said to carry as many cannons as a full Tortugan armada - if not more - and a sweeping tide of damned pirates, that seemingly pour out of the ship endlessly, an outrageous claim in its own right."

Even as a little girl she always dreamed of leaving Tortuga and sailing the Seven Seas and all the exotic places beyond. When she came of age - which is to say when she took her first life on the streets of Tortuga - Miss Fortune decided that she had an affinity for such work and became a bounty hunter. Over the years she used her considerable talents and even more considerable charm to collect many bounties in one song-worthy adventure after the other, which let her fulfill her childish dream of explore the whole of world. Those she hunted grew to calling her misfortune, as any who were on her list would quickly meet their demise. Her reputation and deeds grew and eventually word of them reached back to the now distant ports of Tortuga. Now Pirates of Fortune flock to her sails for a chance to hunt and raid with the infamous Miss Fortune and share in her spoils and glory."

#descr "Jacob the Well Dressed is a former Black Hand. After a song-worthy raid of a very wealthy noble's house, Jacob retired from piracy and started a life of extravagance, lavish balls and philandering. Though the wealth he had looted from the noble was considerable, a veritable king's ransom, his expensive tastes proved to be a fair deal more considerable. His rapidly dwindling treasure allowed him to defile only so many noble women before being faced with utter financial ruin and ostracization from the high society he had grown so accustomed to. When finally faced with the reality of his newly destitute situation, Jacob decided to pull off just one more raid before retiring again, for good this time, and returning to his leisurely way of life. Jacob has come out of retirement several times so far."

However, there are some that take a much keener interest in worldly matters. Tess was once a gifted young witch who used her immense knowledge of foresight and her feminine wiles to uproot a Pirate King and establish herself in his stead as a Pirate Queen. Over the years her popularity and prominence among the pirates has risen considerably, as have her witching powers. A skilled pirate in her own right, cunning, and gifted with arcane and mystical powers, Tess is a force to be reckoned with, and is well known across the Seven Seas, as even the most ruthless of the Pirate Kings pay her due respect."

#descr "Fashionably Late Triple Barrel Jack, commonly known as 'The Crazy Cannoneer', is the most famous pirate cannoneer. Since his earliest days before he could barely hold a cutlass in his hand, Jack was fascinated with cannons, bombs, and all things incendiary. Nothing else but his love for explosions ever held his attention, not even the latest pirate fashions, bejeweling cutlasses, falchions and fine silken clothes looted from nobles of distant shores. Upon reaching manhood, Jack's father - a moderately successful pirate with a humble treasure - presented him with a cannon. Since then, Jack's fascination and interest in cannons continued to grow, and he eventually matured into the best cannoneer among all the pirates. This fascination eventually turned into an obsession that made many pirates whisper that the Crazy Cannoneer would caress his cannons more lovingly than a man could any a woman, for he spent more and more time with these metal behemoths of death, always improving, adjusting, and maintaining them. Some even said that he slept in the arms of his cold mistresses, the barrels of the cannons. In recent years, Jack completely withdrew from the pirate society to the solitude of his cannon workshop and rumor had it he was onto something big. Now, with the arrival of the new pirate god of Tortuga, Jack has emerged from his hermitage to offer his services anew and present his newest invention, the triple barrel cannon. Now, Fashionably Late Triple Barrel Jack serves the new God as one of his most trusted servants in an effort to plunder the world."

The stories say that his greed and will to set the world aflame was so strong that not even death could hope to stop him. Both afraid and fascinated by the Nightmare of the Deep Fathom, pirates and sailors across the Seven Seas began to secretly worship him as though he was a god, either hoping to be spared his wrath, or to join in his misdeeds, inspired by such a terrifying captain. In but a few moons the Seven Seas were plunged into chaos and the world was fraught with terror. Furious at this impudence, the Pantokrator banished the Night of the Deep Fathom to the deepest and darkest recesses of the seas for an eternity. Now that the Pantokrator is gone, the Nightmare of the Deep Fathom has emerged from the depths to yet again pillage the world and receive the prayers of men. Terror and misfortune will spread in any province he is located in."

The spirit is very quick to reform its watery body and will quite literally wash away any seeming injury made to its assumed form. Though completly unable to leave the fountain it inhabits, the spirit can still posses other living beings in its proximity in order to make its will heard and to perform tasks such as forging items or performing enchantments.

#descr "The Damned Cannoneer is an undead pirate brought to life to pillage and plunder once again under the command of a dreaded Damned Pirate King. The cannons of these risen pirates are filled with eternal torment of the damned and will make even the bravest of men break rank and flee. Undead pirates are miserable creatures devoid of all earthly pleasures, but not the urges to pursue those pleasures. Though they cannot feel the sensation of fine liquor burning down their throats, or exquisite food filling up their bellies, they still linger for the taste of it all, never being able to satiate themselves and quench their desires. Those damned will engorge themselves for even the fleeting chance to stave off the ever present hunger and thirst. 

Each cannon is cared and operated by a retinue of trained Cannoneers and should one die in battle a new one will replace him after the battle, unless the cannon is wholly destroyed along with its crewman."

#name "Tortuga"

#era 3
#descr "Tortuga, the pirate kingdom, is a divided society. Tortuga is not so much of a kingdom as it is a barely functioning group of cutthroat, treacherous and backstabbing pirate communities run by self-centered and short-lived Pirate Kings, always in war with one another and numerous other local lords, or even emperors. In times of crises - which are quite frequent due to the deleterious way of life brought on by unscrupulous political maneuverings and double dealings - pirates turn to Sea Witches and Sea Crone for advice and guidance. War is a constant in the everyday life. Pirates enjoy raiding and pillaging unsuspecting victims, and as such they rely on surprise attacks and their weaponry, which they carry in abundance, to carry the day. Pirates rarely use armor due to danger of going overboard and drowning when sailing across the seas."
#summary "Race: Human
Military: Heavily armed but lightly armored troops. Ocean sailing, stealthy units, cannons.
Magic: Water, Astral, Death, Air, Blood and Earth.
Priests: Weak. Can perform blood sacrifice."
#brief "A sea fearing nation ruled by blood thirsty and fame seeking Pirate Kings. Pirates use heavy weaponry but they do not carry armor."

While Exemplars might not be the most powerful of the angels, they are certainly the most holy and virtues, and greatest of spirit. It is for this very reason that the Exemplars cannot be summoned into the mortal realm through various rituals unlike other angels. The Portal of Radiance may only be opened but for a brief moment and only by those pure of heart and through the greatest act of selflessness, self-sacrifice and martyrdom.
Much like all angelic beings, Exemplars too are unable to contain their greatness inside mortal vessels, and are thus much diminished in the mortal realm. Their wispy, tendrilous wings of pure white light and unable to carry them through the air, but rather surround them in a nimbus of greatness. Such is the holiness of the Exemplars that sinners will repent in their presence and turn away from their evil and misguided deeds.

A Martyr Saint must be present in the province in order to recruit Exemplars."

#descr "Descendants of otherworldly angels, the Archons are semi-angelic beings themselves. They preach strong moral values and virtues, and fiercely fight for life, order, and good. Their weapons strike with the power of the Life and Righteousness, and are as such capable of burning undead and demonic beings to cinder. Archons fight for just causes, and preach virtue and obedience to their subjects. They seldom seek to overrun any kingdom, but instead seem to appear where they might most likely be overpowered. Still, they persevere and are fearless in the face of death.
Archons appear as tall, sturdy, humanoids with striking features and a radiant aura that has led many to tremble before them. They are particularly powerful against the Undead."
#summary "Race: Humanoids.
Military: Infantry, archers, cavalry, fliers, powerful sacreds and anti-undead troops.
Magic: Astral, Fire, Air and Water. Saints can boost their magic powers through a death-shape.
Priests: Powerful. Can convert conquered temples instead of demolishing them. 
All national commanders have prophet shapes with different minor bonuses."
#brief "The realm of tall, sturdy humanoids with striking features and a radiant aura. Archons are long lived and generally and more physically and mentally fit then humans. They also poses strong anti-demon and anti-undead capabilities."

-- Industrial Revolution ---------------------------------------------------------------------------

#newspell
#name "Industrial Revolution"
#descr "A group of Workers move from the countryside to the big clockwork cities, looking for work."
#details "Having too many Workers in the province will eventually lead to pollution, which will in turn cause Death scales, a decrease of income, spread of disease, and even unrest. Pollution can be low, medium, or high.

Low pollution: Starts at around 100 Workers; has a 100% chance to increase unrest by +3, Death by +1, and disease 1% of the units.
Medium pollution: Starts at around 200 Workers; has a 50% chance to increase unrest by +4, Death by +1, and disease 1% of the units.
High pollution: Starts at around 300 Workers, has a 100% chance to increase unrest by +2, Death by +1, and disease 1% of the units.

(Effects stack.)

Existence of pollution can eventually lead to smog in any fort with Production 2 or higher, and Death 2 or higher.

Low pollution smog: 15% chance to reduce income by 15%
Medium pollution smog: 15% chance to reduce income by 30%
High pollution smog: 15% chance to reduce income by 50%

(Effects do *not* stack, though high pollution will roll a chance for both high, medium, and low pollution smog, and medium pollution will roll a chance for both medium and low pollution smog)"

More and more uneducated commoners seek out their fortune in the densely populated cities, looking for work in the numerous clockwork factories. On the other hand, those citizens who own the factories and the means of production, or hold particular sets of skills or a proper education find themselves becoming ever-richer and leading leisurely lives, far enough away from the polluted districts of the commoners, but still enjoying all the fruits of their labor. Among this new - bourgeoisie - class of citizens, fencing has become a favorite pastime and indeed a sport that seperates them from the greasy cogs that are the working class."

However using the control rod is very demanding on the rider and they can rarely do more then control their mechanical beasts. Dragon Golems have powerful mechanical jaws and tails and are capable of spraying acidic mechanical fluids that burn flesh.

#descr "With the discovery of the ancient Antikytheran device and the industrial revolution that followed, an ever increasing number of people started to migrate towards packed and densely populated cities that rarely saw sunlight even on the brightest of days due to the sheer volume of smoke and soot in the air. The swift technological progress of the Imperium held the promise of a better life for all those who came seeking work, but delivered death instead. Where industry boomed disease and sickness followed. More and more people started to sicken and die from the fetid and metal-heavy air, overcrowding, and general poor living conditions. Diseases started to spread rampant and in a few short years the biggest cities of the Imperium were brought to their knees and cut in half. The lessons learned in those bleak years have now been put to use and now an increasing number of Plague Doctors ply their trade in the sprawling cities, helping keep the worst of the diseases at bay. The skills of the Plague Doctors are appreciated and indeed crucial for the well-being of the Imperium, though many are still unsettled at the sight of one, both due to their presence often heralding an outbreak of a sickness, but also because the memories of sinister-looking Plague Doctors dissecting the dead, walking on stilts over countless bodies that littered the streets and spraying them with strange chemicals are fresh in the minds of all those who survived the plagues that ravaged the cities."

When a charged body is struck in melee combat, electricity will strike both combatants. The damage caused by the electrical charge is deadly and bypasses armor. Unfortunately, the Technomancer who created this deadly apparatus never did figure out how to make the machine discriminate."

#descr "The Mechanical Lord is truly a testament to the hubris of skilled artificers and Technomancers of Antikythera. A tremendously huge and imposing clockwork construct that surely comes as close to an artificial god as is possible to create. The Mechanical Lord is not affected by heat, cold, shock, or poison, and is layered in thick iron plates, making it nearly imperious to damage. The amount of magic needed to animate and keep such a powerful clockwork functional is far beyond what any mage can ever hope to muster and as such the Mechanical Lord is powered by many enchanted gemstones that keep its clockwork gears ever ticking. Even such a measure is not enough to fully support the great construct as the Mechanical Lord can only function for roughly six months before its core is completely depleted and its gears stop ticking. When such a scenario is near at hand a safety mechanism will automatically trigger and literally rip a hole in space and time, flinging the Mechanical Lord back to its home in order to recharge the gemstones animating the construct, a process that usually takes an additional whole six months to complete."

#name "Antikythera "
#epithet "The Clockwork Empire"
#era 3
#descr "Antikythera is an empire centered around a great city built upon ancient secrets and mysteries. In a remarkably short time, the empire of metal and steam has become a power to be reckoned with. Strange metallic monstrosities dominate the battlefield while men of iron take to the sky. In recent years Antikytherans have denounced all gods and the only thing they worship now is technology and progress itself. Alchemists and Technomancers relentlessly search for ways to bind man and technology together and rumors speak of attempts to create God."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Heavy infantry, hybrid troops of flesh and metal, automatons and superior weapons.
Magic: Earth, Air, Fire, Astral
Priests: Moderate.
Forts: Each month Antikytheran fortified provinces have a 10% chance per friendly dominion point to increase resources permanently by an amount equal to the present Production scales."
#brief "Antikythera is an empire of metal and steam where men of metal rule and the only thing that is worshipped is technology and progress itself."

They worship the Goddess of the Moon and as such are shaped in her reflection. Tricksters by nature, these Tigrans are infamous for their shrewdness and cunning. While they lack the courage and the sheer brutality of Hunter Pride Tigrans, the Prowlers more than make up for it with their sharp intellect and stealthiness. They strike unexpectedly using various tricks and sly tactics, always catching their prey unaware and vulnerable. These Tigrans often carry dual weapons which tend to be devastating in surprise attacks. Much like the Hunter pride, they often carry little to no protective armaments in favor of stealth and speed."

They have grown wise and have become skilled practitioners of magic. Elders are inadequate commanders and rarely lead troops."

#descr "Annointed Priestesses are the arbiters of the Goddess of Many Names. They are blessed with limited foresight and can at times use it to settle disputes before they escalate or even ever appear. None dare strike an Annointed Priestess for she is the embodiment of the Goddess of the Divines and one who dares strike a priestess strikes the goddess herself. With the Moon's recent and ever increasing impudence and audacity, more decisive action is called for. Simply maintaining the balance between the Sun and the Moon is no longer possible. However the Goddess of Reflections is unbending in her ways, but the wind breaks a tree that does not bend."

#era 2
#descr "Although the nomadic human tribes of old are long past from the deserts of Musafir, the Tigrans still remain. Finally free from the shackles of humanity the Tigrans have established a land to call their own. In the time since they have grown both wise and strong beyond reproach. The Tigran society is ruled by three main prides. The Hunter Pride, the pride of ferocious Tigrans who worship the Sun Goddess. The Prowler Pride, the pride of shrewd and reclusive Tigrans who worship Night, Death and Goddess of the Moon. And the Pride of the Divines, the ruling pride that worships the Goddess of Reflections. The Tigran warriors of the various prides diverse in both skill and temperament. While each of the three main prides is ruled by sages and driven by different ambitions, all of them still adhere to the wisdom of the all-knowing Mystics and Anointed Priestesses."
#brief "In the scorching deserts of Musafir is the realm of intelligent tigers. With the disappearance of the nomadic human tribes, the tigers have organized into a complex society ruled by three main and unique prides."

#newmonster 4050
#name "Eolian Slinger"
#descr "The Eolian Highlanders were always known for two things; poverty and enthusiasm for slings. Rich in little apart from rocks, slinging was a popular pastime in Eolia. The Eolians made their slings from not a single thong, but rather of three, strengthened with stitching which provided against the slipping of the bullet. Their slings had a longer reach and a surer aim and it was even said they could hurl their missiles through small rings placed at a considerable distance. Where professional armies with archers and swordsman fell before the undead legions, the Eolians' simple slings triumphed. Now the Eolians use weapons and armor and carry lead bullets forged and smelted by Thirnan smiths."

#descr "Slinging was not only practiced by men in Eolia, but by women too. When the undead legions swept across the lands, and Death was at Eolia's doorstep, all Eolians took up slings to defend their ancestral lands, and defend it they did, for a time. But as the undead legions grew in number, the Eolians were forced to leave their homeland, lest they be overrun. It is at Fenrel that they made their stand against the undead along with the other exiled peoples. It is at Fenrel that the Eolians united with the remnants of other kingdoms and managed in holding Death at bay. Unlike men, the Eolian War Maidens use staff slings. The staff slings can throw heavy projectiles a much greater distance and at a higher arc, and are nearly as accurate as hand slings in practiced hands. The staff itself can also become a close combat weapon in a melee."

#era 2
#descr "When Death was let loose Ermor fell, but it did not fall alone. One by one the surrounding lands crumbled into ash before the onslaught on the ever-growing undead legions as the very land was stripped of life. Some managed to escape the impending doom however. They led what remained of their people away from the disintegrating empire and were soon met with refugees from other lands. But mere escape was not enough to save them as Death walked in their wake and threatened to consume them. The splintered nations banded together and formed a loose alliance and for the first time Death was held at bay, not by magic, or by faith, but through iron will and determination. Thus Fenrel was born. Fenrel is a newly-founded kingdom of exiles. Remnants of destroyed kingdoms band together to form Fenrel. The war machine of Fenrel has been modified to better fight the undead, and soldiers from various lands now complement each other."
#summary "Race: Human.
Military: Slingers, infantry, cavalry, sacred paladins, siege weapons and engineers.
Magic: Astral, Fire, Water, Nature, some Earth. Scholar researchers.
Priests: Powerful. Can heal disease."
#brief "Fenrel is a nation of refuges from various lands banded to together in a singular case, to combat the blight of the Ashen Empire."

However, if the Sudjaja are displeased and the rituals followed poorly, it is not uncommon that the child dies soon afterward."

#descr "A White Vila is a powerful female spirit of the wild who appears as a young woman of otherworldly beauty, dressed in a thin white dress. Vilas are treacherous and whimsical by nature. They are able to fascinate men, luring them into servitude with spellsong. They also posses the power to heal men as well as harm them and they use these powers frequently and indiscriminately. A Vila's magical powers and strength is believed to be hidden in her mantle, the mystical shroud all Vilas wear. Should a Vila lose her mantle, she would lose all her powers and would be easy to slay. While the Court of White Vilas is not the most powerful of the courts, it is certainly the most wide spread and known."

#descr "Svarogia is a shadowed forest realm in which treacherous demonic spirits roam the wild freely, sometimes helping and guiding the people of Svarogia, and sometimes punishing and killing them, according to their whim. In this cold and unforgiving land, the weak and incautious are preyed upon or succumb to the dangers of the wild, leaving only the strongest and most resilient. Armor of quality comparable to that of most other nations is rare. Consequently, the Svarogians are a hardened people, tougher and stronger than most. In the countryside, soldiers skilled in stealth warfare band together as Haiduk mercenaries, rebels or bandits. With the coming of the ascendant god, the people of Svarogia have banded together under the guidance of the demonic spirits to conquer the world."
#summary "Race: Strong humans and demonic spirits.
Military: Light and medium infantry. Archers and light cavalry with composite bows. Stealthy Haiduk raiders and berserkers. Sacred medium infantry with magic greatswords.
Magic: Air, Nature, Death, Blood and Astral.
Priests: Weak. 
Prefer Cold Scale 1."
#brief "A cold, shadowed forest realm of hardened humans and demonic spirits. Its military uses light armor, but features unique troops and summons."

#descr "As gold is inherently associated with wealth and grandeur, and doubly so in Aurum, it is no wonder that the Paragons of Aurum have sought out and discovered the means to animate this precious metal as both a demonstration of both wealth and power. By melting down vast quantities of gold and then enchanting them, the Living Gold is created. It is an enormous mass of molten gold that exudes intense heat. Anyone standing too close to the Living Gold will get severely burnt. The Living Gold is extreemly slow due to it's high density and mass, however, those struck by it will get crushed under the weight of gold, and then melted into the mass as the inner temperature of the animated creature is immense. The Living Gold shrinks when damaged."

The rune inscribed Idol shines with such a brilliance that burns all undead and demonic units to cinders. The statue is magically powerful and possess potent astral skills. The Golden Idol would probably be impossible to destroy even though it cannot strike back."

#descr "The commonly known as 'Goldo IV the Weak' among the people is the very last of the long line of kings. The Last King is a powerful mage and a seasoned warrior but was never loved or considered an adequate nor capable leader. He was quickly given the title 'Weak' by the people for losing the Kingdom to the dark God. Every fortnight or so a servant girl would go missing from the palace hence it was widely believed that Goldo dabbled in the forbidden arts of blood magic. Some believe that his beastly use of blood magic attracted the dark God in the first place and awoke his hunger and lust for the kingdom's riches and knowledge. The Last King is a masterful blood mage and is able to call horrors to his side during battle. Misfortune will befall any province he is located in."

#name "Aurum "
#epithet "The Golden Tower"
#era 2
#descr "After a long and particularly bloody war, Aurum fell to a mysterious enemy. Cities were scorched to the ground, and walls that protected them crumbled into nothingness. A shadow of death swept across the Empire. Even the golden capital with all its splendor and glory, tall walls and brave men, fell to ruin. The Arkenstone Forges, the forges of gold which provided the nation with superior armaments, perished, and the great Golden Tower, a beacon of knowledge and the symbol of Aurumian power, was torn down. With the promise of restoring Aurum to its past glory, the Aurumian people have subjugated themselves to a new God. Aurum has been rebuilt with the forges of gold bustling with activity once again and the Golden Tower reconstructed. However, the scars of a devastating war still mark the golden city. Beneath the city undead hordes still roam the complex system of tunnels in the crypts known as the Undercity, and the once powerful Paragons now possess but a shadow of their former power."
#summary "Race: Strong humans and summonable undead.
Military: Extremely heavy infantry and cavalry, powerful sacreds with second form.
Magic: Fire, some Astral, some Earth, some Death, Nature. More diversity through summons. Powerful summons, unique units and various national spells.
Priests: Average. Powerful summonable priests."
#brief "Aurum is a human kingdom famous for its superior armor and weaponry. The majority of troops use heavy gold armor and weapons which are of better quality than any found in other lands. The Paragons of Aurum give good magical versatility and powerful battle magic."

Her rule marked the beginning of a golden age, a time of great welfare and prosperity, that lasted until her sudden transformation into the first of the abhorrent Driders. Ancient tales say she was cursed by a spurned lover, though the truth is a thing long forgotten. Vainly she searched for a way to undo what was done to her and with each passing year her hatred and malice grew. Shortly thereafter the Dark Elves were created and some believe the timing to be more then a coincidence and consider the First Queen the progenitor of the Dark Elf race."

#era 1
#descr "Azarien, the land of eternal dusk and despair is the home of the Dark Elves, a race as sinister as it is ancient. At some point in history this once noble race parted ways with sanity and wisdom and descended into utter madness and unrelenting hatred. It is unclear whether they fell under some corrupting influence of the world, or if they married themselves to it willingly. Ruled by competing urges for indoctrination and genocide, the Dark Elves foster contempt for all other races, and those subjugated suffer every possible form of injustice, oppression and cruelty. However, their homicidal tendencies and malice are not limited just to other races either, as Dark Elves routinely murder their rivals, cousins and even parents. Such behavior is not only accepted but sanctioned, believed to cull the weak and keep Azarien under powerful and ready leadership. As is only expected, Dark Elves lurk in the darkness, ever keeping to their shadows. Rarely will they come into the light for needless purposes, and some even believe that light can harm or weaken them. They are known for their deceitful nature and wicked ways, but maybe most importantly for the unnatural and twisted experiments they perform on other races, and even their own kind. Many horrors are known to lurk in the dark forests they call their home."
#summary "Race: Frail humanoids, poison resistance, darkvision.
Military: Light infantry, medium infantry, archers, cavalry and stealthy units.
Magic: Blood, Astral, Death, Nature, very minor Air.
Priests: Weak. Can blood sacrifice."

#descr "The Meteor Druids are philosophers, mages and priests that tend to Dur-Halam's most holy site, the Meteor Crater. It is here that they perform religious ceremonies, study astrology and constellations, and try to gain insights into the will of God by watching signs far above. They are not often seen by the people of Dur-Halam, as they rarely venture far from the Meteor Crater."

#newmonster 3820
#name "Slave King"
#descr "It is said that Goliath was fathered by a giant and born an orphan as his mother could not bear the stress of childbirth. Even as a child he has much taller than even some of the adults. Fearful of the giant and driven by hate of everything that is different than them, the people of the village enslaved Goliath and put him to intense manual labor. Over the long years of mistreatment Goliath became cruel and hateful. And then one day the great meteor fell and Dur-Halam was set ablaze. Little is know of what transpired in the village during the confusion but one thing is certain; Goliath had broken free, slaughtered the entire village and proclaimed himself king. Goliath discarded his chains just long enough to have them tempered with the meteor metal as they serve as a harsh reminder of the true nature of men. Though Goliath is a king he commands no armies as he despises the people of Dur-Halam, but he gladly serves the God that set him free and revels in any opportunity to exact his revenge."

He burned and burned as the flames continued to lick at him but Krel did not perish. In fact, Krel has remained ablaze to this day as the meteor flames ceaselessly dance around him. Many believe him to be chosen by the meteor God and it is said that Krel's flames can not be quenched as long as the metoer God of Dur-Halam watches over him."

It is well known which parts of the forest Cohen calls his own and those wise enough avoid venturing there, lest they be mauled by wolves and bears. With the meteor-fall Cohen has decided it was time to break his isolation and venture back into civilization once more."

#descr "Much has been gleamed by the Meteor Druids by observing and studying the movement of the stars. With this ritual, a skilled Meteor Druid can reach for the starlit sky and pull down a star from the firmaments, and guide it towards a desired location, often with devastating consequences. The falling star will shatter in countless little pieces as it nears the ground that will wreak havoc among any of those unfortunate enough to be caught present. Performing this ritual is no easy task as it requires both great skill and immense timing and prediction on the part of the Meteor Druid to hit a moving army."
#details "Seventy five meteors strike any army located in the province. This attack occurs after regular movement phase and thus any army moving out of the targeted province won't be hit. If cast on the besieged fort, it will strike the sieging army. Furthermore, 8% of the population in the province will be killed, unrest will increase by 30, and there is a 20% chance that either a lab or temple get destroyed."

They are often used as skirmishers and are typically deployed as a first wave. Ruby Spider Automatons are not expected to last throughout any battle, and indeed, that is their design, for once they are critically damaged, their ruby cores will detonate in a small, controlled explosion, and kill or severely burn anyone nearby.
Unlike other automatons, the spiderlings are much more fragile and easier to destroy, though they are also far easier to create, and don't require much maintenance and upkeep."

They easily swarm their targets, crawling over and overwhelm them all the while eviscerating them with their sharp mechanical limbs. The frightening speed of their attacks allows these spiders to kill unprepared and poorly armored troops within seconds, and chase down fleeing soldiers. Unfortunately, the incredible speed and frantic bursts of action of these automatons also deplete their cores much faster than other types of spiderlings, making them fall silent on the battlefield all the quicker.

#selectnation 123
#name "Antikythera"
#epithet "Land of the Automata"
#era 1
#descr "In a distant and secluded valley, long-since forgotten by the world, a great citadel unlike any in all the lands of men, an unassailable fortress that should surely have taken an entire lifetime to build, seemingly rose overnight, ambitiously reaching for the skies much to the dismay of the few native inhabitants of this isolated valley. In this impossible structure of metal and stone and shinning gems live the brilliant artificers now known as the Master Makers, mage-smiths of great wisdom and knowledge.
Little is known of these enigmatic figures, expect perhaps the genius that allows them to create inscrutable and marvelous metallic beings capable of doing the strangest of things, and their kindness towards the impoverished and struggling natives of the valley who are spared being pressed into any kind of service, or even paying exorbitant taxes necessary to maintain armies akin to those in other lands, while yet enjoying the protection of the Master Makers and their automata none the same.
Spring-driven automatons powered by precious gemstones imbued with powerful elemental magic guard the citadel of the Master Makers, and all those who now call this new realm their home. 
Towering metallic giants, tall as towers, stand vigil at the gates of the growing city, while automatons as tiny as a street cat, and just as agile, scurry along the busy streets, thisaway and thataway. High up on the parapets the ever-crackling and buzzing sound of lightning can be heard from tall machines that steadily hum with power, and the entire city reverberates with the ever-present sound of hammers and metallic gears tick tick ticking away."
#summary "Race: Automaton constructs. Production bonus 50% in all forts. Income penalty 25%. Mercenary penalty 25%. Capital starts with 15k population.
Military: Heavily armored automatons, colossal automatons, specialized automaton commanders.
Magic: Astral, Earth, Air, Water and Fire. Superior magic item forging. Research-bots not affected by Drain scales. Capital only mages.
Priests: Very weak"
#brief "Antikythera is the land of clockworks and spring driven automatons, ruled by mysterious and powerful Master Makers."

#mainlevel 2
#name "The Ineffable Ring"
#descr "This strange, cursed ring bears powerful protective enchantments, but is worn at great cost to its bearer. It vigilantly protects the wearer, conjuring a few Barrow Wights to his side whenever he is in danger. It binds the wearer to the flows of magical energies in the area, making him more resistant to hostile magics and mightier where ambient magic energies are high. However, wearing the ring is demanding and taxes the well-being of the wearer. The ring will make the bearer feeble, and will exhaust him with every step in combat. His dependence upon magical energies will weaken him further, instead of strengthen him, if they are low. It will vex him by taking away his power of speech. Finally, as a side effect of the strange magics of the ring, the owner will develop a taste for human flesh, and will soon find himself impelled to hunt local villagers to satisfy his ravenous cravings."
-- GLOBU NOTE -- I took some liberties here. If it's a bit much, I'll happily do another rewrite of the original, keeping more closely to its wording and structure.  I wanted to add something about the wraith knight raredomsummon, but it's already really long and I wasn't sure what turns of phrasing and ideas you were more or less wanted in there.  Also: This is one fucking serious ring. Nice design!

#descr "The Pendant of Death was devised by a legendary Dread Lich and is a true masterpiece of craftsmanship. When its power is invoked, the pendant will discharge a powerful ripple of Nether energies across the designated province, slaying hundreds and drawing their souls into the death gems embedded within it. The pendant will then open a mystical portal through which the souls of all those slain will stream in a current to a distant province. The caster will then ride this current to its destination, where the shambling corpses of the recently dead now await his command. The pendant can only be used by the undead, as it would consume the bearer's living soul as surely as it would take the souls of those further from it."

All who died that day were bound to a great tome in which their downfall was recorded in verse. By reciting their tale, the owner of the tome can summon forth their longdead corpses and ghosts to join battle and relive their death once more. The death cries from that ancient battle will shriek forth from the tome, causing those timid and weak of heart to quickly rout. The tome can only be used by the undead."
-- GLOBU NOTE: Because there is no way to restrict it to necromancers, I've changed all places where you say an item can only be used by necromancers to say that it can only be used by undead.  Too bad, there should be a way to restrict an item in that way.

-- GLOBU NOTE -- I added the "servant of Eljudnir" part to make it clear that it's friendly only. I also added the "within an hour of the blessing" because as far as I know this effect does not carry over between battles, and it might confuse the player who might think it's like twiceborn or something.  I don't know though -- if I'm wrong, and it persists, then of course that hour part should be taken out.

This strange dual existence prevents them from being permanently killed, instead only banished, for a short period of time, to the Neather Realm, from which they always return with ever more hate and loathing for the living. Wraiths feed off the souls of the living, turning them into soulless upon death. They live out a hollow existence of endless torment and jealously seek to bring a similar fate to the living."

The countless years these creatures have misspent in lamentation and woe causes them to hold a tenuous grasp on the physical realm, at best. While they can no longer harm the living or interact with the material realm, they can project their own woe and torment onto others. Those who fail to resist these projections will quickly despair, falling silent as the grave and succumbing to a catatonic state, their vigor stripped from their bodies as surely as hope is stripped from their hearts. Powerful magical protection and a strong will may offer some protection from the soul-wrenching projections of the Sanctified Dead."

Over hundreds of years the Order served kingdoms and empires to fight the hosts of the Nether Realms, and hunted infernal and dread beings where they secretly skulked. Its knights fought valiantly wherever forces of darkness threatened. But over time their numbers grew thin and their struggle grew desperate. Worse, they were blamed for the coming of the Nether beings and exiled from the lands. Embittered by the ingratitude and cruelty of those they protected, they undertook one last quest to put an end to their long struggle. They achieved their goal only in tragic irony; during the course of their quest they succumbed to their hatred and turned it upon humanity itself. Weary and vengeful, they cast aside their bond to mankind and offered their service to the Nether Realms. Now, riding their shadowy steeds, they bring death and misery to those they once protected."

-- GLOBU NOTE -- It might totally be me, but there's something that's confusing to me and doesn't make sense.  Are the flames holy or unholy?  (In the original description, it's said both ways -- a bit inconsistent.)  Is Eljudnir holy or unholy?  If it's all holy in the eyes of its adherents, wouldn't it all be holy?  Or, likewise, if it's all unholy in general, wouldn't it be unholy?  Generally everything holy to one religion is unholy to someone else.  Maybe change it all to holy, except, where appropriate, use a different word, like awful, terrible, sickly, deathly, etc.  Again, maybe just me being pedantic.  :3

The countless years these creatures have misspent in lamentation and woe causes them to hold a tenuous grasp on the physical realm, at best. While they can no longer harm the living or interact with the material realm, they can project their own woe and torment onto others. Those who fail to resist these projections will will quickly despair, falling silent as the grave and succumbing to a catatonic state, their vigor stripped from their bodies as surely as hope is stripped from their hearts. Powerful magical protection and a strong will may offer some protection from the soul-wrenching projections of the Sanctified Dead."

#descr "Death Knights were once virtuous, noble-born men who bound together in a secret Order to fight the enemies of humanity. Over hundreds of years the Order served kingdoms and empires to fight the hosts of the Nether Realms, and hunted infernal and dread beings where they secretly skulked. Its knights fought valiantly wherever forces of darkness threatened. But over time their numbers grew thin and their struggle grew desperate. Worse, they were blamed for the coming of the Nether beings and exiled from the lands. Embittered by the ingratitude and cruelty of those they protected, they undertook one last quest to put an end to their long struggle. They achieved their goal only in tragic irony; during the course of their quest they succumbed to their hatred and turned it upon humanity itself. Weary and vengeful, they cast aside their bond to mankind and offered their service to the Nether Realms. Now, riding their shadowy steeds, they bring death and misery to those they once protected."

#descr "Wraith Knights are the spirits of ancient champions, born of shadows and hatred, summoned from the Nether Realm to take physical form. Wraith Knights feed off the living, and with each consumed life their powers grow. Their appetites are insatiable, and their periodic depredations cause unrest wherever they visit. Once seriously injured, Wraith Knights will abandon their physical body, emerging in their shadowy incorporeal form. If not completely destroyed in battle, Wraith Knights will reform their corporeal bodies over time. Wraith Knights possess limited magical powers, and are able to call down a rain of searing banefire on their enemies."

#descr "Eolian was once a famous noble of great wealth and fine lineage in Eljudnir. The ambitious noble was tutored by the pre-eminent scholars and philosophers of his age, and was well-versed in swordplay and arts. But all of his refinement and accomplishment meant nothing when his father's lordly title was to be inherited, for he was the second-born son and would get nothing. Denied what he felt was his rightful inheritance, Eolian listened to the whispering dreams of death and soon became enticed with the promises of eternal life and power. He orchestrated a great feast where he slaughtered his family and their entire household using black magic, opening the portal to the Nether Realm and establishing the Second Realm of Death. For his services, Eolian was granted great and terrifying powers, and wields command over the knightly wraith order. Eolian now grows in power with each passing month by consuming the souls of his former countrymen."

The ambitious noble was tutored by the pre-eminent scholars and philosophers of his age, and was well-versed in swordplay and arts. But all of his refinement and accomplishment meant nothing when his father's lordly title was to be inherited, for he was the second-born son and would get nothing. Denied what he felt was his rightful inheritance, Eolian listened to the whispering dreams of death and soon became enticed with the promises of eternal life and power. He orchestrated a great feast where he slaughtered his family and their entire household using black magic, opening the portal to the Nether Realm and establishing the Second Realm of Death. For his services, Eolian was granted great and terrifying powers, and wields command over the knightly wraith order. Eolian now grows in power with each passing month by consuming the souls of his former countrymen."

#era 1

#descr "The Nether Realm is the realm of Frost and Death, of Decay and everlasting Perdition. It is the land of the dead where the souls of the wicked live out a miserable and tormented existence. Now, the veil separating the Nether Realm from the mortal, has weakened. Jealous of the living, the tormented souls of the Nether Realm have started seeping through the breach into Eljudnir, the first land of many to fall. The hollow existence of the undead has been given purpose, to purge the world of living and bring about eternal woe. Deathly, cold winds invigorate and surround these beings in an embrace of everlasting frost, tempering their bodies. They are vessels of Winter and Death, and their powers are greatest where it is coldest. The undead of the Nether Realm carry specially-crafted weapons, imbued with dark powers and corruption, that sap the very souls of the living. All those slaughtered by such weapons will arise to serve their slayers and bolster the ever-growing undead ranks."

-- GLOBU NOTE -- "No missile weapons"?  What about banebows and the like...?
#summary "Race: Frozen undead. Prefer cold scales +3.
Military: Powerful but extremely Cold-dependant and Fire-susceptible troops. Weapons can reanimate those killed in battle at times.
Magic: Death, Water and Air.
Priests: Weak; can reanimate undead, create national undead and create dominion-spreading shrines.
Dominion: Spreads Cold and Death (max 3)"
#brief "Eljudnir is the newly-founded kingdom of the undead, where the tormented souls of the Nether Realm have broken through the veil that separates this realm from the Nether Realm."

#name "Claim the Firstborn"
#descr "A host of ghostly faeries descends upon an unsuspecting settlement and steals all the firstborn children, taking them back to the Faery lands of Elphame. In absence of firstborn babies to steal, the Fay will take those firstborn who are young, or newly-wed. Few truly know what fate awaits those taken by faeries as some are said to be taken to be servants, others to be raised as one of the fair folk living long and happy lives, others yet used for torturous entertainment, or even eaten alive. Whatever the case may be, many take to simple charms such as dressing young ones in inverted coats, or leaving open iron scissors where children sleep to ward the faeries off."

#name "As Luck Would Have It"
#descr "It is said that the Wishing Stone is able to channel all the good fortune of the faery realm and consume it in order to fulfill the wish of its supplicant, and many other lesser wishes across Elphame. However, none but the Queens of Faery are wise to the Wishing Stone's secrets and able to channel its powers. Though the Stone is quite literally capable of granting any wish one can dream of - assuming there is sufficient good fortune to draw upon to make the wish real - the Faery Queens are quite incapable of going against their rigid nature and wishing for anything other than to extend the influence of their own court and season over all others.
Channeling the good fortune of the land is not without its risks however, for balance is everything in Elphame. As much as a faery cannot grant something without receiving something else in return, the Wishing Stone cannot grant dreams to one, without takes them away from another. Once the Wishing Stone's power is consumed and its purpose fulfilled, unrest will spread across Elphame, and ill-fortune will quickly follow in the wake of any wish granted to even out the scales."
#details "Consumes Luck 3 scales and places Misfortune 3 scales in Elphame provinces with friendly dominion where requirements are met, and triggers a random good event while also increasing unrest by 10. Additionally, grants 15 + 2d3 Summer Fay, as well as 2d4 + 2d4 Fire gems, and increases Heat scales worldwide by +1. 
Casting the spell requires and consumes the Wishing Stone.

As much as a faery cannot grant something without receiving something else in return, the Wishing Stone cannot grant dreams to one, without takes them away from another.

A Fool's Bagrain is a bargain ill-struck with one of the Fay, made either in desperation or foolishness."

#newspell
#copyspell "Infernal Prison"
#name "Trapped Inside a Fable"
#descr "The powers that the Fay may call upon are primordial and ill-understood by most mortal wizards, for their particular brand of magic is quite different, and seems almost instinctive comparatively. There are many strange abilities the Fay are rumored to possess, though perhaps chief among them is their seeming ability to bend time to their will. All know impossible tales of men and women who had accidentally or foolishly ventured into the lands of faery and returned to their homes days later, only to discover years, or even centuries had somehow gone by.

With this ancient bit of trickery a faery will create a powerful enchantment and blanket a small portion of the land with it. All those within this enchanted area will find themselves subject to the whims of the faery who will be able to, quite literally, turn back time and reset the day for all those within the enchanted area. Though the faery will retain her ability to turn back time and reset the day, doing so will not magically mend the wounds of those injured, nor bring those killed in the enchanted area back to life at the turn of the clock. The only thing that prevents a faery from eternally trapping others in such a maddening prison of time is the necessity of being present in the enchanted area for the enchantment to work, a fact that would eventually lead to the faery's discovery and demise."
#details "The battle will abruptly end and all units on the battlefield will repeat the battle anew, with whatever forces they have left, or whatever new forces might have arrived in the province in the meantime.

And being fiercely intelligent creatures by nature, Pixies will be exceedingly difficult to drive out, capture, or otherwise kill. However, due to their overly curious and child-like nature, these little imps can get easily distracted while exploring foreign lands and opportunities for small mischief on the locals will often catch their fancy, considerably slowing down their progress and perhaps even raising alarm to their yet unseen presence.

#descr "Many fables and near-forgotten stories talk of strange faery doorways that lead to distant places, magical portals and paths where one might go down a seemingly simple trail and by accident emerge in a place distant and foreign, hundreds of leagues away. Even among the long-lived Fay most such trails remain an ancient mystery to all but a select few. Being utterly alien and functioning counter to any expected logic, such paths remain virtually undetectable to all despite often existing in plain sight. Some of the these long-forgotten faery path that stretch the length of the world have even been repurposed by oblivious peoples at the dawn of their civilization who built their own roads on top of these already existing faery paths. A path going around the edges of a small grove might transport a person who chooses to walk it counter-clockwise three times in a circle half a world away. A dusty old road leading into a small town might send one traveling it far into the far-flung mountains if one were to step away from it just a league before town, and then walk backwards for a length. 
Among the Fay, such paths are best known to Fay Assassins and some of the more mysterious wild fay. The assassins of Elphame often use such paths to quickly travel between places through paths unknown and seldom guarded. The swiftness with which the assassins can travel from one place to another depends entirely on their knowledge of the intricate web of faery paths that connect all places. Consequently, the speed with which one may travel these hidden paths depends entirely on one's ability to find them and know where they might lead.

Fay Assassins will have varying and unpredictable amounts of map movements each month, but never less than their basic map movement."

Being utterly alien and functioning counter to any expected logic, such paths remain virtually undetectable to all despite often existing in plain sight. Some of the these long-forgotten faery path that stretch the length of the world have even been repurposed by oblivious peoples at the dawn of their civilization who built their own roads on top of these already existing faery paths. A path going around the edges of a small grove might transport a person who chooses to walk it counter-clockwise three times in a circle half a world away. A dusty old road leading into a small town might send one traveling it far into the far-flung mountains if one were to step away from it just a league before town, and then walk backwards for a length. 
Among the Fay, such paths are best known to Fay Assassins and some of the more mysterious wild fay. The assassins of Elphame often use such paths to quickly travel between places through paths unknown and seldom guarded. The swiftness with which the assassins can travel from one place to another depends entirely on their knowledge of the intricate web of faery paths that connect all places. Consequently, the speed with which one may travel these hidden paths depends entirely on one's ability to find them and know where they might lead.

Fay Assassins will have varying and unpredictable amounts of map movements each month, but never less than their basic map movement."

#descr "The courts of Elphame do not have organized armies lead by distinguished generals akin to those of other lands. Instead, their armies are composed of a random mix of all faeries willing or forced to fight, typically lead not by experienced battle commanders but rather the most terrifying among the fay. In times of all-out war, such leadership typically falls to the fay queens, but for less important battles the honor of leading smaller groups of fay typically falls to various heroes and champions of the courts, and even vicious butchers if the army in question is one of Winter."

To say that Elphame is a realm of utter turmoil due to such intrigue would perhaps be a correct yet profoundly ironic understatement in as much as to say that a hurricane makes for a bit of a windy weather.
Most of the lords and ladies of Elphame reside in or near their respective courts and spend the majority of their ample free time plotting cruelties big and small against other nobles of their courts, but more frequently against the arch rivals of their courts, the opposing courts."

#descr "Each of the four courts of Elphame reflects the spirit of the world during the time of its rule, and is aligned or attuned to one of the four elements, and either the power over Life, or Death, depending on its temperament and inclination towards one or the other. The Spring Court is one of rebirth and renewal. Its rule breaths new life into the world and ushers in a season of bounty, blooming and lush and infatuating. It is a time of growth and the life-giving, gentle yet stern Spring storms, and rains that revitalize the land and drive away the bitter cold of Winter and the stench of things dead and dying. The powers of the Spring Court are tied to the elemental magic of Air, and to a lesser degree the power over Nature, or rather Life itself. Much like that of all the Seasonal Courts, the powers of the Spring Court wax and wane with the passing of the seasons, slowly growing until they reach their height mid-Spring, and then continuously eroding until they reach their lowest point during mid-Autumn, the season of their arch rivals and polar opposites, the Autumn Fay.

The power of the Spring Queens will shift with the passing of seasons, increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, much like the Seelie Fay, the Spring Queens have a 15% chance to cast a random spell instead of a scripted one."

The Autumn Court is wise, reflective, but mournful overall, for it announces the passing of life and frailty of all things. Its rule signifies the inevitability and tragedy of death. The rule of Autumn is perhaps feared even more than that of Winter itself. Though Winter is death and darkness incarnate, cruel, vicious, and finite; Autumn is the slow process of dying and decay, of life slowly stripped of all joy and pleasure. Many might not fear death itself, but few are dauntless when faced with a downfall prolonged and unabrupt. The powers of the Autumn Court are tied to the elemental magic of the Earth, and to a lesser degree the power over Death itself. Much like that of all the Seasonal Courts, the powers of the Autumn Court wax and wane with the passing of the seasons, slowly growing until they reach their height mid-Autumn, and then continuously eroding until they reach their lowest point during mid-Spring, the season of their arch rivals and polar opposites, the Spring Fay.

The power of the Autumn Queens will shift with the passing of seasons, increasing or decreasing. Furthermore, much like the Unseelie Fay, the Autumn Queens have a 15% chance to cast a random spell instead of a scripted one."

The Autumn Court is wise, reflective, but mournful overall, for it announces the passing of life and frailty of all things. Its rule signifies the inevitability and tragedy of death. The rule of Autumn is perhaps feared even more than that of Winter itself. Though Winter is death and darkness incarnate, cruel, vicious, and finite; Autumn is the slow process of dying and decay, of life slowly stripped of all joy and pleasure. Many might not fear death itself, but few are dauntless when faced with a downfall prolonged and unabrupt. The powers of the Autumn Court are tied to the elemental magic of the Earth, and to a lesser degree the power over Death itself.

There are many tales that recount when people caught by the faeries would steadily look at them, they would sometimes appear as dead neighbors, deceased lovers, or family members long since lost. For this reason many perceive faeries as the untimely dead who left unfinished lives, a view which might explains why Faery Godmothers when summoned by mortals, typically children, take such great care to protect them from danger, perhaps on account of being the deceased family members of those who seek or need their help.
Though Faery Godmothers stem from the Winter Court, shrouded in icy winds, horrifying to behold and immensely cruel and wicked, they still take exceptional care of their charges in as much as their nature allows them, and only show the true colours of their madness to those who would attempt to harm those they protect."

#descr "It is said that Faery Dragons cannot die and continue to live a half-life even after their corporeal forms have been destroyed. The torrents of magic that flows through these creatures keep them alive long after they have been slayed. Those Faery Dragons which are killed simply rise up as ghostly apparitions of themselves, reanimated by the vast wells of magic coursing innate in their kind. Ghost Dragons are largely the antithesis of what they were in life. The once beautiful creatures with striking, iridescent scales now appear as nightmare fuel for all those manage to somehow steal a look. Their very presence seems to inspire a sense of dread and foreboding and bad things happen to those near one. Though these frighting creatures can no longer wield magic or heal themselves as they could in life, they can now sap the life force of others to replenish themselves, and even shred and corrupt the souls of those they touch, trapping them in unlife too. Ghost Dragons are exceedingly malevolent creatures and belong to the deepest recesses of Winter, reserved for those most horrifying creatures of faery."

A road traveled north may lead you south, or may never lead to the same place twice. Even walking up a flight of stairs may somehow yet lead one to the basement of a building in Elphame. Though despite these peculiarities, the realm of Elphame is also very constant and unmoving in other regards, representing the physical manifestation of the seasons and as such the lands of the Seasonal Courts being eternally bound to their respective seasons. One will never mistake the lands of the Winter for the lands of the Summer, for the Sun will always be in zenith in Summer, and harsh winds and heavy snowfall will always accompany one throughout Winter. 
Some say there are realms yet beyond Elphame, and that these ethereal and eerie Fay come from the Twilight Court."

#descr "Elphame is home to many mystical and fantastical creatures, but perhaps none more so than the fascinating Faery Dragons. They are deceptively charming and striking creatures with iridescent coat of scales that reflects all colors of the rainbow, but predominantly reflects one particular color which changes with their mood. In truth, Faerie Dragons are mischievous and whimsical creatures, far worse than any group of Pixies. Little is known about these notorious troublemakers. What sparse knowledge exists is more readily found in storybooks and children's tales than magical tomes. Some say they are invisible. Some say they can cast spells better than any sorcerer. Some say they have magical scales that are resilient to all forms of magic and even weapons.
Faery Dragons are innately magical creatures capable of drawing upon ambient magic to instinctively cast a wide array of powerful spells despite having no actual magical talent or training. Besides their ability to cast spells, they are also capable of drawing on the same ambient magic to quickly heal and knit lesser wounds inflicted upon them. However, if seriously wounded in battle, the Faery Dragons will lose both their ability to cast spells and heal themselves, and will instead resort to striking out with their claws and teeth. Unlike regular dragons, Faery Dragons exhale a cone of magic gas that bewilders and confuses those bathed in it, allowing the Faery Dragon to slip away when seriously wounded and pressed. Faery Dragons will not resort to using their magic breath unless they are seriously threatened in battle.

Faery Dragons are capable of casting a plethora of different and powerful spells. Each battle round a random spell from a set will be chosen and cast, and all wounds inflicted will be instantly healed. Should a Faery Dragon be sufficiently wounded in battle - and forced into its second shape - it will lose its ability to cast spells and heal itself for the remainder of the battle."

#descr "Elphame is home to many mystical and fantastical creatures, but perhaps none more so than the fascinating Faery Dragons. They are deceptively charming and striking creatures with iridescent coat of scales that reflects all colors of the rainbow, but predominantly reflects one particular color which changes with their mood. In truth, Faerie Dragons are mischievous and whimsical creatures, far worse than any group of Pixies. Little is known about these notorious troublemakers. What sparse knowledge exists is more readily found in storybooks and children's tales than magical tomes. Some say they are invisible. Some say they can cast spells better than any sorcerer. Some say they have magical scales that are resilient to all forms of magic and even weapons.
Faery Dragons are innately magical creatures capable of drawing upon ambient magic to instinctively cast a wide array of powerful spells despite having no actual magical talent or training. Besides their ability to cast spells, they are also capable of drawing on the same ambient magic to quickly heal and knit lesser wounds inflicted upon them. However, if seriously wounded in battle, the Faery Dragons will lose both their ability to cast spells and heal themselves, and will instead resort to striking out with their claws and teeth. Unlike regular dragons, Faery Dragons exhale a cone of magic gas that bewilders and confuses those bathed in it, allowing the Faery Dragon to slip away when seriously wounded and pressed. Faery Dragons will not resort to using their magic breath unless they are seriously threatened in battle.

Faery Dragons are capable of casting a plethora of different and powerful spells. Each battle round a random spell from a set will be chosen and cast, and all wounds inflicted will be instantly healed. Should a Faery Dragon be sufficiently wounded in battle - and forced into its second shape - it will lose its ability to cast spells and heal itself for the remainder of the battle."

#descr "Elphame is home to many mystical and fantastical creatures, but perhaps none more so than the fascinating Faery Dragons. They are deceptively charming and striking creatures with iridescent coat of scales that reflects all colors of the rainbow, but predominantly reflects one particular color which changes with their mood. In truth, Faerie Dragons are mischievous and whimsical creatures, far worse than any group of Pixies. Little is known about these notorious troublemakers. What sparse knowledge exists is more readily found in storybooks and children's tales than magical tomes. Some say they are invisible. Some say they can cast spells better than any sorcerer. Some say they have magical scales that are resilient to all forms of magic and even weapons.
Faery Dragons are innately magical creatures capable of drawing upon ambient magic to instinctively cast a wide array of powerful spells despite having no actual magical talent or training. Besides their ability to cast spells, they are also capable of drawing on the same ambient magic to quickly heal and knit lesser wounds inflicted upon them. However, if seriously wounded in battle, the Faery Dragons will lose both their ability to cast spells and heal themselves, and will instead resort to striking out with their claws and teeth. Unlike regular dragons, Faery Dragons exhale a cone of magic gas that bewilders and confuses those bathed in it, allowing the Faery Dragon to slip away when seriously wounded and pressed. Faery Dragons will not resort to using their magic breath unless they are seriously threatened in battle.

Faery Dragons are capable of casting a plethora of different and powerful spells. Each battle round a random spell from a set will be chosen and cast, and all wounds inflicted will be instantly healed. Should a Faery Dragon be sufficiently wounded in battle - and forced into its second shape - it will lose its ability to cast spells and heal itself for the remainder of the battle."

#selectnation 167
#name "Elphame"
#epithet "The Faery Courts"
#era 1
#descr "The Fay are magical beings of great powers, but also ones fundamentally and rigidly bound to their peculiar nature, lacking the free will to act against it. Most faries are often quite insane too, though their particular brand of insanity is perhaps of a different color to that of mortals, and is perceived through their capriciousness, whimsy, and inability to act reasonably. One of the better known yet misunderstood shackles of the Fay is their inability to outright lie. However, being exceptionally deceptive, the Fay are very adept at word-play and twisting their meaning and walking the thin border of falsehoods and implied truths. Built into the Fay is also a great urge to entrap mortals and seek to make bargains, or enlist oaths and promises from them, which, when spoken to the Fay, carry with them great power and turn true and unbreakable. Lastly, all Fay are ultimately shackled by the concept of balance, of give and take. Apart from being bound to only speak the truth, the Fay are also quite unable to offer up anything - no matter how trivial - without receiving something of equal worth in return. As such, a deal struck that is anything but an equal exchange will be deemed either enticing or an insult, and therefor one would be wise to never accept nor offer anything to the Fay of their own volition, for all of reality might depend on it.
Elphame is divided into four seasonal courts ruled by corresponding Queens of Spring, Summer, Autumn, and Winter. As seasons change in Elphame, so shifts the influence and power of the Queens, ever expanding and dwindling, in an endless, repetitive cycle. Conflict is a constant between the Courts of Faery, as it is in their nature, yet the balance of power can never be broken. Though there are four royal courts of Elphame, one for each respective season, most of the Fay belong to one of two main groups, the Seelie Fay - those of the Spring and Summer Court - and the Unseelie Fay - those of Autumn and Winter."
#summary "Race: Faeries. Unwilling to pass rivers as running water washes away their powers.
Military: Low morale across the board. Sacreds and Faery Queen recruitables change from season to season. All national units have a +6 mapmove bonus in friendly dominion. 
Magic: Fire, Air, Water, Earth, Nature, Death.
Priests: Powerful.
Dominion: Spreads Luck and Turmoil. 5% per dominion point chance to increase by +1."
#brief "Elphame is the realm of the Fay and it is ruled by the four Seasonal Courts whose powers shift with the passing and coming of their respective seasons."

The Oak-Heart has amazing regenerative abilities and will quickly sprout new branches and roots should they be cut away during combat, making it extreemly difficult to put these lumbering monsters down. Their lashing branches and vines are capable of quickly entangling any nearby foes, making it that much easier to crush them afterwards with their trunk and thick branches. However, the magic that animates the Oak-Hearts is short lived and the trees themselves will revert to an inanimate state not long after combat is over, looking like nothing more than just another old oak."

#descr "The Druid of the Grove ventures deep into the heart of the forest in search of a fitting location to perform a most holy druidic ritual. Once in a place where the presence of many ancient spirits of the forest can be felt, the druid will prepare for the ritual and spend the next few days tattooing his entire body and covering it in magical, biding symbols. Once the placing of tattoos is complete, the druid will establish a communion with one of the spirits of the forest and be joined with both a chosen and willing spirit. The druid will take on the characteristics of his spirit animal which will be bound within the druid's tattoos. The tattoos will automatically flare to life any time the druid is in peril. Some druids have also been known to create amulets which allow them to temporarily take physical form of their spirit animals."
#details "After performing this ritual, the casting Druid of the Grove will be able to transform into either a Wolf, Bear, or a Boar in battle though the use of a an eponymous amulet of the same animal. The druid will inherit some of the traits of the animal chosen, signaling their chosen spirit.

#descr "The Druids of the Grove form an ancient order of priests of Nature who care for wildlife and perform ancient ceremonies to appease the spirits of the land. They are learned men of diverse fields of study, though all of them primarily study Nature magic. 
In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Ermorian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

	#descr "Like all warriors of Nemeton, the Forest Archers also carry weapons imbued with powerful magical properties whilst in forest. However, unlike melee weapons, the enchanted arrows are capable of pinning down the enemies of Nemeton to the forest floor from afar, and entangling them to it. Vines will grow from the fired arrows, and slowly entangle those struck by it. Even the large tower shields employed by Ermorian legions offer no protection from Sylvan Bows as the vines will entangle anything they hit. Consequently, the Forest Archers are often used as the first line of defense."

#descr "Deep within the sacred groves of Nemeton dwell ancient and powerful spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. These spirits reside within strong, proud oak trees and are able to animate their old and rigid bark and branches, and stir them into action. As such, Sylvans are commonly mistaken for the ancient Treelords, and while they share certain similarities, they yet share no common link or ancestry. 
The Sylvans use their mastery of Nature magic to create powerful spellweavings, shield the forests of Nemeton from prying eyes, and even create resources needed for weapons, quickly growing branches and trunks for woodworking and even sensing ore deposits close to the roots of the forests. In turn, the druids of Nemeton tend to, and protect the Sylvans. Their magic, however, is not without limit, and as soon as the guardians leave the forests, the glamour and enchantment granted to them will instantly shatter. Sylvans are capable of uprooting themselves in order to travel large distances, though not at an inconsiderable risk, as while uprooted, Sylvans lose some of their magic power, and grow weaker and weaker each month, until they eventually wither away and die. While in a forest, Sylvans are virtually undetectable, and hard to find even when not."

Though Keepers of the Grove are novice Water mages, some of them also devote a portion of their time to study Nature. While in forests, those Keepers with some knowledge of Nature will be able to draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain further insight into Nature magic. "

#descr "The Druids of the Grove form an ancient order of priests of Nature who care for wildlife and perform ancient ceremonies to appease the spirits of the land. They are learned men of diverse fields of study, though all of them primarily study Nature magic. 
In recent years the druidic orders have all but been wiped out by aggressive Ermorian campaigns to ban and destroy all spirit-based worship. It is only in Nemeton that the druids were given respite and protection by those same spirits of the land. Now the druids care and tend to the Sylvan groves, and in return the Sylvans extend their glamour to the druids, sheltering them from prying eyes, and eager swords.
While in forests, the Druids of the Grove can draw upon the knowledge of the land to gain insight into Nature magic."

#selectnation 139
#name "Nemeton"
#epithet "Hidden Groves"
#era 1
#descr "With Ermor's swift rise to power and prominence came the persecution of the numerous, scattered druidic circles. In the ensuing years of Ermor's aggressive military campaigns many druids died, but many also fled far and wide, until they discovered an ancient and hidden grove unlike any they had ever seen. There, the exiled druids were given shelter and protection by the primordial spirits of the forest, called the Sylvans. Now, the druids of Nemeton and the Sylvans live in communion and safeguard each other against would-be intruders. 
The druids of Nemeton live in small communities centered around sacred Sylvan groves. They rarely build permanent settlements or fortifications as they have little use for them. Instead, they rely on powerful Sylvan enchantments to shelter them from prying eyes. The people of Nemeton are capable of moving unseen through forests, as the very forests guide and reinvigorate their every step. Even the weapons they carry strike with the power of the forest and entangle those struck by them."
#summary "Race: Human. Have no use of forts. Can only place additional settlements in forests, by moving Sylvans and creating new groves. 
Military: Light and medium infantry, light boar cavalry, archers. Troops become stealthy while in forest, and receive weapons that can entangle. 
Magic: Nature, Earth, Water, some Air. Mages gain +1 Nature magic while in forest.
Priests: Average."
#brief "Nemeton is a sanctuary to numerous druids, exiled and hunted down by Ermor. It is also the home of the Sylvans, ancient and powerful spirits of the forest."

#descr "With this horrendous ritual a Black Witch swallows a common house spider and through the use of dark arts incubates a swarm of spider eggs within her body. After a few weeks the spiders will burst out of the still living body in a perversion of child-birth, and start consuming her body and growing to monstrous size. The more powerful a witch, the greater the number of spiders she will be able to hatch."

At the moment of her death, a Black Witch will invoke the Death Curse and fuel it with all the power she can access and the remainder of her quickly fading life-force. The curse's target is typically the witch's killer, though the curse can be directed at anyone, regardless of physical distance, and can even affected numerous people, or even a whole land. Some Black Witches have even been known to commit ritualistic suicides in order to cast especially powerful Death Curses."

In such a time lived the old, wizined witch, the very first, the most powerful, and the most wicked.

Now, they are cursed souls who have far since abandoned last vestiges of hope and redemption and have fully given in to malice, corruption and hatred. Though the Blazing Wardens were once men, they now appear as towering skeletal giants engulfed in a perpetual searing flame, a physical manifestation of the evil that has grown to gigantic properties within their cursed souls over the long centuries. The sacred duties they once swore to uphold have now been twisted in ironic mockery as the Blazing Wardens stand vigil over the cursed and evil lands they once sough to protect the world from. Blazing Wardens carry huge flaming spheres of metal attached to chains which they wield to devastating effects. When the flaming spheres strike something they explode in a shower of flame that burns its targets as well as anyone nearby."

Whether they are demons, or spirits, or inanimate objects animated to life with malignant magic is unknown, but one things is certain, Scarecrows are horrifying monsters that revel in terrorizing the local populace. They rarely outright try to kill, but rather take great delight in frightening their victims until their frail hearts give out, or Hollows come to devour their terror-filled souls, now blazing like a great bonfire, clearly visible to Hollows.
The Scarecrows are believed to be able to distort perception of those around them, as surely that is more believable than distorting the very reality. Projected images of the Scarecrows will dance around the battlefield, jumping out and terrorizing all those around them, including allied troops."

#descr "It is not clear whether Pumpkin Lords are humans afflicted with one of many terrible curses inherent to the cursed domain of Hollowmoor, or yet some malign spirits which inhabit this curious man-vegetable hybrid. Whatever the case may be, the end product is still the same; a bloodthirsty and gore-covered being that goes around decapitating heads with grim satisfaction, and bloody scythe in hand. The blood-soaked sight of a Pumpkin Lord is a terrifying one to behold in battle. They seem capable of commanding any type of monster and as such often lead the misfit monsters of Hollowmoor into battle under the directions of the Dark Lords. Pumpkin Lords take great delight participating in annual Autumn Harvests, when they ride into the open countryside and farmlands, and compete in their own twisted blood sports.

Each Autumn, the Pumpkin Lords can venture out into the open plains and farmland provinces to conduct their gruesome annual Autumn Harvest, capturing many virgins, killing many, and raising many Pumpkinheads from the slayed in the process. The Autumn Harvest is conducted at the height of each month of Autumn."

Children have been known to disappear before delicious cauldrons of tenderized meat arrive to a village. The Wizened Hags go nowhere without their giant cauldrons and are consequently totally unable to pass rivers. The Wizened Hags are particularly fond of the company of the Butchers."

There are no recorded documents or scriptures on the Hollows and next to nothing is reliably known about them, even though their very existence seems to permeate and plagues every waking moment of the entire population. Indeed, rare are those that can even see them and rarer still those who can brag about escaping their tendrils unscathed. Though the scarcity of knowledge on the Hollows does not stop the spread of rampant rumors and far-fetched tales, it quite possibly might be the reason for them. Two things are known for certain, however; that Hollows feed on the souls of the living, leaving the pitiful Wretched in their wake; and that they are able to perceive the terror-gripped hearts and minds of the population as a beacon that draws them in. The very mention and even thought of a Hollow is believed to summon them. The theories around the Hollows are wild, fanciful, and without base. Some consider them to be the jailers of Hollowmoor and instruments of punishment. Other yet believe them simple otherworldly horrors. But there are those that suspect a truth much darker and frightening; that once, long ago, the Hollows might have been human."

Whether they are demons or spirits or inanimate objects animated to life with malignant magic is unknown, but one things is certain; Scarecrows are horrifying monsters that revel in terrorizing the local populace. They rarely outright try to kill but rather take great delight in frightening their victims until their frail hearts give out, or Hollows come to devour their terror-filled souls.
The Scarecrows are believed to be able to distort perception of those around them, as surely that is more believable than distorting the very reality. Projected images of the Scarecrows will dance around the battlefield, jumping out and terrorizing all those around them, including allied troops."

The Banshees can hear voices and predict the deaths of other beings. Often, they assume the appearance of a sweet singing virgin of the family who died young and has been given the mission by the invisible powers to become the harbinger of coming doom to her mortal kindred. At times, she may be seen at night as a shrouded woman, crouched beneath the trees, lamenting with veiled face, or floating past in the moonlight, crying bitterly. And the cry of this spirit is mournful beyond all other sounds on earth, and betokens certain death to some member of the family whenever it is heard in the silence of the night."

Though one might expect unrest and chaos to spread in the wake of the soulless Wretched, the exact opposite seems to be true. The peasants are sympathetic to the victims of the Hollows for they know such fate might await any of them. Ironically enough, it is exactly the Wretched that protect the remaining population from the recurring visits of the Hollows. Where their sight is common the population quickly becomes apathetic, defeated and forlorn, losing any hope for life, and the will to fight for a better morrow, for they know that their life filled with utter terror and torment can only ever be substituted for one devoid of any feeling, emotion, or love. Such hopeless places are rarely visited by the Hollows again, who perceive the terror-filled hearts and minds of the peasants as a beacon that draws them in."

Faceless spectres, not unlike Hollows themselves roam this deep crevice of the keep, whom follow the Spirit of Sorrow as so to confound her with her inability to remember their meaning.

#descr "The Impaler was once but a common man, a footman in the army of a great emperor. Through his remarkable valor and resourcefulness he won the respect of his fellow soldiers and was soon elevated to to the rank of a minor lord and given the thankless task of protecting the war-torn disputed border lands between the empire and its century-long rival. It was a task the new lord performed exceptionally for years on end, despite the ever-dwindling support from the emperor, and the constant plotting and ridicule of the pretentious aristocracy that hated him for his common ancestry. His prowess and the vigor with which he sought to protect the common people of the land won him the hatred of both the enemies across the border, and his supposed allies. Threatened by the young lord's tactical genius and accomplishments, the emperor sent him to sign a peace treaty with their arch-nemesis in his stead, not knowing that he himself would indeed be part of the peace accord. Betrayed by his countrymen, he was promptly chained and manacled like a dog. Though he was beaten senseless and tortured for a full year, his resolve never buckling, and he never broke. It remained so, until the enemies he had gathered, the lords, ladies and emperors of both realms - those who so wished to see him broken and humiliated - presented him with a sight that instantly shattered his sanity, the still screaming and twitching sight of his impaled family. The young lord broke free from his shackles that day, and a dark shadow fell upon both empires. Much transpired in the following years, all of it horrifying and sickening to the core. Impaled corpses littered the landscape of both crumbling realms, and the Impaler's power had become such that those impaled could not stop their wails of agony even in their death. 

The Impaler is exceptionally skilled at pillaging provinces and can create horrid creatures known as the Impaled that continue their wails of torment well into death while doing so."

#descr "Though the Baroness is one who seems least dreadful and terrifying of the Dark Lords, she is in fact far more wicked than her more monstrous counterparts. She was born as the youngest and only female heir to a rather powerful ruler whom fate had bestowed numerous children. Being raised in such a fiercely competitive environment with many brothers, she quickly picked up the sword and shield, instead of the much expected needle and twine, much to the dismay of the court and her royal parents. The Baroness showed great proclivity for swordplay and all things military, and even though she was uniquely gifted, much more so than any of her numerous brothers, attempts were made to sequester her from her foolish dreams. Forced to peruse her interests in unlikely and unsavory places for somebody of her status, the Baroness quickly became a social pariah, an outcast everybody ridiculed and shunned. Even among the lowly, dull-witted commoners she was considered a laughing stock. When the old emperor finally passed away and his many sons began to feud and grapple for power, the foolish little girl obsessed with swordplay was thrown out of the royal palace and stricken from everyone's mind. In that hate-filled instant the Baroness decided to unleash devastation and slaughter upon her whole royal family. Unleashing a torrent of blood and murder, she quickly ascended to the empire's throne, with a blood-stained dress and sword in hand, before the Mists took her.

No weapon that Baroness ever picked up was for long left unmastered by her. She is believed to even be able to manipulate the very Mists of Hollowmoor, and use them to conceal her troops, and keep them hidden from enemy scouts."

#descr "The Death Knight is one of the Dark Lords of Hollowmoor. According to ancient records, the Death Knight was once a valiant prince of a small realm, happily married with a beautiful princess, rumored to posses the gift of foresight, with whom he awaited a child. One night his wife dreamt a terrible cataclysm that would tear the kingdom apart, and which only her beloved husband could stop, but at the cost of his life. Upon hearing these dire prediction he swore such a future would not come to pass and that he would save the realm and thus his family, and set off on his noble quest. On the way, he encountered three witches who slowly poisoned the young prince's mind with lies about his wife's infidelity. They prompted to mock him about his naivety, setting off on a wild-goose chase while his whore of a wife gave birth to a bastardly child. Having finally succumb to the witches' lies, the now enraged young prince turned from his selfless quest to save the realm and went back to confront his wife, and the newborn babe she was now cradling in her arms, just as the cataclysm began. In the ensuing devastation, a chandelier fell on his wife, causing a great fire and setting her aflame. As she burned to death, his wife only begged for him to save their child and take him away from the spreading flames, but in the young prince's moment of indecision and doubt the flames engulfed the child, consuming him alongside his wailing mother. With her last dying breath his wife cursed him to live out the lifetimes of all the souls whose death could have been averted by him on that cursed day had he not fallen into madness, and upon pronouncing the curse the young prince was set aflame and swept away by strange mists, along with the three witches who had poisoned his mind - now risen as Banshees, cursed to remind him of his folly every night until the curse is broken."

#descr "The Spirit of Sorrow is one of the Dark Lords of Hollowmoor. She is the most ancient of the Dark Lords and her fate is the least known one for even the numerous books dedicated to her transgressions have long since turned to dust. It is unclear whether the cursed prison of Hollowmoor was specifically created to keep her confined or whether there were perhaps other Dark Lords before her, now complete forgotten and faded. Her very presence seems to either announce or directly cause the birth of Lamenting Ghosts, which call her 'Mother' though blood-curdling wailing shrieks. Due to this, many believe the Spirit of Sorrow to be the very first Banshee, and the mother of all heralding spirits. Great sorrow hides behind her mournful and empty eye sockets, seeming to speak of some ancient and terrible tragedy that even now, countless centuries later, still torments the spirit."

#descr "The Butcher of Nightmares was born a simple farm child, to a loving mother and a cruel, abusive father. As he grew up he was tasked with the responsibility of tending to the animals, work he thoroughly enjoyed. But as the years passed and the little boy matured a day came where his father bid him assume other responsibilities, those of slaughtering the farmyard animals that he so loved. Horrified at the prospect of killing his beloved friends, the now adolescent rebelled against his wicked father. That dark day, it is said, the boy died and a monster took his place. As punishment for his rebelliousness the boy's father made him perform hideous vivisection on the still living and twitching animals, until the boy's eyes were completely dry of tears, and were now filled with something dark and sinister. In the following years the boy went on to became a famous butcher, one taking great pride in his abilities and skill with the cleaver. It took many years after people first started disappearing for the truth to come out. The Butcher's dark appetites were finally discovered when he was accidentally caught quite literally red-handed, in the midst of a vast slaughterhouse, full of countless hooked rotting corpses, dismembered animal and human part, and the overpowering, putrid smell of blood that permeated throughout the entire building.

The Butcher of Nightmares is capable of chopping off limbs in a single strike and all those who follow him will bask in his bloodlust. His blood-stained apron and monstrous appearance is horrifying to behold on the battlefield. His legend and tales of his slaughter have grown to such proportion that he has received a substantial cult following from all sorts of twisted and sick individuals who try to follow in his footsteps, hook and cleaver in hand."

#descr "The Flesh Angel was once but a young and very plain mage with no ambition or aspirations for anything other than mediocrity. Her entire life was always quite unremarkable in every shape and form, until one day she first laid her eyes upon a handsome young lord. Immediately she was smitten and fell in love with him, but sadly the feeling was not reciprocated. Such as she was she could never hope to win his heart, so she sought to make herself irresistible by using dark and forbidden magic. Inexperienced and average as she was in everything, she failed to perform the complex ritual correctly. The weaving was a success, but it was too much of a success. Her beauty transcended that of the Divines. To look upon her was to feel unreasonable wanton and carnal desire. Soon she was nicknamed the Angel of Beauty and no man was without lust for her. Terrible and unimaginable things were then done to her by the men of the city, but perhaps nothing that happened was more terrible than what the women of the city did to her. While her beauty stirred up lust and desire in all men, it awoke pure, unadulterated hatred and jealousy in the hearts of the simple women of the city. They captured her and mutilated her body, ripping the flesh and skin of her back with metal spikes to resemble wings. They turned her into an ironic mockery of an angel, but even in that horrible instant, the weaving she had wrought never abated and stopped enchanting those who saw her. She became the Flesh Angel, a creature horrifying to behold, yet irresistible. The things that were done to her shattered her fragile mind and turned her into an abomination.

Now, the Flesh Angel feeds on the lust of men, and vitriol of women. Her horrifying beauty plagues their dreams, and she is able to enter them and devour their souls to feed her blackened and hollow heart."

#name "Hollowmoor"
#epithet "The Cursed Prison"
#era 3
#descr "Long ago a magical prison unlike any other was conjured to keep the Dark Lords in eternal confinement. Thus Hollowmoor came to be. The cursed domain was devised as an instrument of endless torture and frustration where even the Dark Lords would be oblivious of their own fate in the grand apparatus. Their souls, black and empty such as they were, became forever bound to the lands of Hollowmoor. While immortal within their own dominion, the Dark Lords are utterly unable of escaping its narrow confines. But no prison is without flaw. While the barriers that confine the Dark Lords in their own personal hell are as powerful as ever, the borders of the prison have weakened, slowly spreading their cursed tendrils across the world.
Hollowmoor is a land of eternal torment and suffering where the tiniest bit of fortune quickly turns to bad luck. It is a place where even death does not provide escape from a harrowed life. The lamenting cries and the terror filled dreams of the population act as a beacon perceivable by Hollows, invisible monstrous creatures that stalk the countryside devouring the souls of the population, leaving them empty, soulless husks, sentenced to toil onto oblivion.
The very land of Hollowmoor is treacherous and wicked, and seems to have a will of its own, seemingly able to change beneath ones very feet. A villager might discover that a journey that usually takes but an hour, one that he has made dozens of times in the past, suddenly necessitates an arduous trek of a week or more. Such strangeness has a tendency to manifest at the worst possible moment, such as when ravenous Hollows worry a traveler's step.
A veil of misfortune and unrest plague the inhabitants of Hollowmoor, and thick magical mists spread from it. The Mists of Hollowmoor disorient and confuse all those who would enter them without a proper guide, seeping far and wide into the world, and sweeping up unwary travelers, merchants, and even entire villages back into the cursed lands."
#summary "Race: Various types of monsters. Dominion spreads unrest and Misfortune scales. Pretenders of Hollowmoor are incapable of leaving friendly dominion without dying. The lands are continuously covered in the Mists of Hollowmoor. Provinces with temples attract Hollows, and higher levels of dominion attract exponential numbers of Hollows.
Military: Undead giants, living, magical and undead troops. Light and medium infantry, missiles units, cavalry substitutes. 
Magic: Death, Blood, Nature, some Fire, Astral, and Earth. Average priests.
Priests: Average."

When thrown, the spheres will shatter upon impact, bursting into flames and engulfing all those standing nearby. The Desert Flames are extreemly effective vs targets that wear nothing more than highly-flammable cloth or leather armor, such as those often worn by most Musafir tribes. As such it is little wonder that those in possession of the Desert Flame's secret were once highly revered and avoided.

Poisoners are commonly regarded by the travelers as being exceptionally skilled hunters for indeed the alternative to being a skilled hunter would almost certainly be death in their world. These hardened desert recluses hunt the gigantic Black Scorpions that dwell in the deserts of Musafir and extract poison from their glands which they use to coat their arrows with.

As such Desert Outriders need to be able to cross great distances at times and only employ the fastest horses. Though they are equipped with much lighter gear than most other light cavalry, the tremendous force of their charge has been often known to break well equipped and well armored ranks. The remarkable speed of their horses also allows them to run down any stragglers after a minor skirmish, or outrun a superior army that seeks to engage a poorly equipped force."

More recently, however, with the ban on tribal slavery, the slave trade has shifted to enslaving the Tigrans, a race of tigers that dwell in the forests or open savanna plains. While the Tigrans are a fierce and proud race, the cat people are still unsophisticated and relatively easy to catch with nets and fast horses, which has lead the slavers to abandon their classical camel mounts in favor of fast horses. Most slavers are somewhat cowardly. If they find prey capable of mounting a resistance they will more often than not retreat and seek out easier victims instead."

In Musafir, there would likely be no traveling tribes without camels so it is little wonder that these beasts hold a special significance and are considered to be almost holy. Their worth is such that it is said that a Musafir husband takes better care of his camels than he does of his wives. Indeed, the wives of Musafir take care of their husbands, the husbands take care of the camels, and in turn the camels provide for them all. Camels are working animals especially suited to their desert habitats and are a vital means of transport for nomads and their cargo. On the long journeys they provide milk and meat and even textiles as the clothes the nomads wear and the tents they sleep in are woven out of camel hair. A tribe's wealth is often measured in the number of camels it possesses. In times of war, these great beasts are also used as battle mounts. Though not as fast as Musafir horse breeds, the dromedary of Musafir are much more reliable, capable of going up to several days without water, and easier to ride."

#name "War Elephant"
#descr "Though most of Musafir consists of endless, sprawling deserts, there yet exist rare patches of fertile land and bountiful oases, teeming with life. Here, many rare breeds of animals can be found and among them even elephants. Trained for use in battle, their sheer size allows them to trample soldiers and horses. Elephants are intelligent beings with minds of their own. Once hurt, they become enraged and terrified, seeking to leave the battlefield by the shortest possible route and trampling friends and enemies alike. The War Elephants of Musafir are mounted with two booming war drums which, coupled with the their great size, makes for an ominous presence on the battlefield."

#name "Gargantua"
#descr "Endemic to the desert plains of Musafir, the Gargantua is the largest animal known to the Travelers. It is believed that these animals continue to grow in size their entire lives, until they grow so huge, that finally, their enormous tusks outweigh the rest of their body and the beasts collapse, unable to bear their own weight. The Gargantua are exceedingly rare for a number of reasons, chief among them being the vast appetites of these beasts in the near-lifeless deserts. Though these lumbering beasts are slow, they are still considerably dangerous, capable of crushing anything beneath their imposing bodies. A tamed Gargantua is a pack beast like no other, easily able to carry the weight of an entire caravan. The Gargantua is like a mobile fortress which is why it is especially favored among the Tajir of Musafir, the spice merchants and traders that are under constant risk of being raided due to the valuables they carry. It is perhaps due to the Tajir that these beasts have survived for so long as they rely on the merchants for food as much as the merchants rely on them for protection. The Gargantua are strange beasts capable of producing metallic shrieks that cut straight into the minds of all those nearby, paralyzing them for a moment. They are also seemingly completely oblivious to any sense of danger, perhaps due to their sheer size and lack of natural predators. The body of a Gargantua is near impervious to damage, its leather being incredibly thick and tough."

Rocs rule the skies of the desert plains of Musaif. They are capable of shifting the colors of their features in quick succession, mesmerizing and entrancing any potential onlookers.

Though historically the tribes of Musafir often competed against each other over access to the small patches of rich grassland and the sporadic oasis, as of late the tribes have banded together to form a lose coalition under the new, self-proclaimed god of the Harsh Sands. In times of war, the Wise Masters will lead the warriors of their tribes on mounted camels into battle personally, for a tribe lives or dies together, both man and camel alike."

#descr "Slave Masters lead the Sharir, the slavers of Musafir. With the recent shift in politics and an explicit ban on tribal slavery, the slavers of Musafir now have to look beyond the borders of the desert in order to conduct their business. The Slave Masters oversee the capture of the tigrans and organize slave auctions where the captured tigers and foreigners are sold into slavery. Slave Masters command great authority though fear and are very skilled at keeping the tigrans and human slaves alike in line through the use of their whips. Slave Masters are masterful hunters and the presence of A Slave Master with no less than five Slavers under his command will often increase the number of tigrans captured while out paroling a land alongside a Slaver Caravan. Though the ban on slavery only prohibits the slavers from enslaving the travelers of Musafir, it does not prohibit slavery as a whole. Consequently, the Slave Master now have to venture out to foreign lands to gather human slaves. A Slave Master with no less than five Slavers under his command will capture as many as one hundred and fifty people a month in non-Musafir lands to be brought back to the lands of Musafir in chains and sold at slaver markets.

This Slave Master has captured some four hundred and fifty slaves so far."

#descr "Being a wandering people, constantly on the move, the nomads of Musafir travel far and wide. On their distant journeys they always acquire new, exotic things that can often be sold for a hefty profit in some other part of the world. These tribes that travel between other tribes of Musafir are the Tajir, or the traveling merchants. Spice Caravans are formed from groups of merchants who traverse the world and make their living selling spices in various tribes and settlements. Due to their particular way of life, the Tajir have become crafty and skilled salesmen and are well known for driving a hard price if a lucrative business opportunity is at hand.

Spice Caravans travel within the confines of the borders of Musafir, always moving from city to city, selling their goods to the locals. Though the prices they fetch selling their spices in friendly Musafir settlements are favorable, they are not as favorable as those the Distant Spice Caravans fetch traveling to other, distant nations where such goods are rare and luxurious. Though the Spice Caravans do not follow the Spice Trail to other realms, they are still capable of fetching considerable profits in those lands where a Musafir settlement is located.

Spice Caravans can trade by entering other Musafir settlements, those of Azraq, Slavers, Farseers, and other Tajir. No more than two caravans a month can hope to sell their goods at any given Musafir settlement before the saturation of the market drives down the price too much for a profit to be had."

Spice Caravans are formed from groups of merchants who traverse the world and make their living selling spices in various tribes and settlements. Due to their particular way of life, the Tajir have become crafty and skilled salesmen and are well known for driving a hard price if a lucrative business opportunity is at hand.

Distant Spice Caravans follow the Spice Trail to other realms, hoping to drive up their prices in the far reaches of the world where their goods are not a common sight like in the lands of Musafir and are often considered something of a luxury. The price a Distant Spice Caravan can fetch in a foreign city is considerably higher than those had in Musafir settlements. Many a caravan even takes the long journeys to the sprawling markets of the capital cities of distant lands. The profit to be had in such a venture can be enough to set a merchant up for life, though the trip is often not one without risk either, as the caravans sometimes get attacked during their travel and even betrayed by those they traded with by being rounded up and executed after. 

Distant Spice Caravans trade by entering the fortified cities of other nations. No more than two caravans a month can hope to sell their goods at any given distant city before the laden caravans of Musafir saturate the market and drive down the price too much for profit to be had. Distant Spice Caravans also gauge their prices in foreign capitals, though traveling such vast distances can be dangerous and often incurs great upkeep expenses during the many-month travel. Once the goods are sold, the Distant Spice Caravans return to Musafir settlements to deliver the profit."

Slaver Caravans are used both to capture the tigrans and to transport them to slaver auctions where they are sold off for a hefty profit. Slavers habitually hunt for tigrans in the open plains and forests, for those are the natural habitats of the tigrans."

With a new god of the Harsh Sand on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

Unlike the Travelers, the Traveler Caravans will also disassemble and pick up any presently located building into building blocks to be carried off with the caravan on numerous beasts of burden. Though such an undertaking requires many camels and is expensive, it is also often worth it. Traveler Caravans cannot be recruited in the City of Musafir for none would allow such an act."

As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

This Traveler Caravan is currently in the process of settling down and assembling a laboratory and a temple."

#descr "The numerous and far-flung tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a harsh, nomadic way of life, always moving from land to land, in search of better fortune and a permanent oasis to call their own. With a new god of the Harsh Sand on the rise and a loose alliance of the nomadic tribes on the brink of forming a nation under united leadership for the first time, the need to wander the desert has lessened. Even so, such an integral part of the Musafir culture cannot be changed overnight for even the very word Musafir means traveler.

Travelers are small nomadic tribes that migrate from land to land and typically consist of roughly a thousand people. As the various tribes of Musafir still harbor some small amounts of distrust against one another, no more than a single tribe, a single group of Travelers, will move from nor settle in a particular land at the same time.

Unlike the Travelers, the Traveler Caravans will also disassemble and pick up any presently located building into building blocks to be carried off with the caravan on numerous beasts of burden. Though such an undertaking requires many camels and is expensive, it is also often worth it. Traveler Caravans cannot be recruited in the City of Musafir for none would allow such an act."

#descr "The people of Musafir place great emphasis on the afterlife and regard the dead with great reverence. All those who die are burned and their ashes scattered across the plains of the dead, those of the harsh, sandy deserts of Musafir. The people of Musafir believe that they constantly travel between the two lands, of Life and Death, for if one stops and stays in the lifeless desert for too long, only Death will greet him. When a tribe perishes in the desert, it is often believed that they strayed too far in the lands of the dead and were claimed by them. The fact that such tribes are often laid to rest by Spirit Guides reinforces the belief.
It is the Spirit Guides that tend to the funerary rites of the people of Musafir. As the unyielding deserts of Musafir are considered holy and not of this world, only the Spirit Guides are allowed to spread the ashes of the decently cremated. Even though their roll in the tribal society of Musafir is essential, the burden of these spiritualists lies in being ostracized from the tribes, for men who stand between the two worlds belong to neither of them. Spirit Guides are only sought out to perform cremations and to carry the ashes to the spirit world."#ap 12

It is said that these mystics can gaze into the desert flames and see great things yet to come. Much of their time is spent gazing into the flames of future. As they often live out as hermits; sequestered in the Harsh Sands of Musaifr, far from any tribal intrigue or politics, they do not hold as much priestly powers as the Soothsayers do. In times of great calamity and turbulence the Farseers will venture back into the tribes of Musafir and deliver the prophecies seen in the desert flames. Though the Farseers are known for their reclusive lifestyle, they do not always life alone. Often, traveling tribes that stray too close to a Farseers home will find themselves watched by the giant Golden Scorpions, implying that these mystics posses more power than they lead on to have. With the coming of the new Lord of the Harsh Sands, the Farseers have abandoned their hermitage and have started banding under a loose and scattered tribe of their own. Many now choose to serve these holy mystics that are foretelling the new dawn of Musafir under the Lord of the Harsh Sands."#ap 12

An Envoy is a diplomatic head of mission with plenipotentiary powers to represent the interests of the Ministry. Besides having full authority when it comes to arranging favorable trade deals, the Envoys also act as spies and gather sensitive information which they then pass back to the Ministry through various caravans."

#name "Musafir"
#epithet "The Wandering Tribes"
#era 1
#descr "Musafir is a vast desert plain where numerous, small and spread-out nomadic tribes dwell, continuously migrating from oasis to oasis and vying for control with other tribes over the few precious resources the desert has to offer. A recent shift in politics, brought on by numerous prophetic visions from Soothsayers and now returning Farseers alike, has ended the tribal conflicts and given rise to the uniting of the desert tribes under the leadership of the new god of the Harsh Sands. Musafir now stands as a nation of loosely-tied tribes. The centuries-long practice of enslaving other tribes has mostly ended but slavery still exists, possibly stronger than ever. The enslavement of the traveler tribes has been substituted for the mass enslavement of the newly-discovered Tigrans, a race of ferocious but primitive intelligent tigers, and other nations.
The tribes of Musafir have long since accustomed themselves to a life of a traveler. Indeed their very name, Musafir, means one that travels. They are used to never settling for long in one place and have even developed ways of migrating entire settlements. Though the forts they build are often small and primitive - a reality of the harsh life in the desert, their simplicity makes it possible for them to carry the building blocks using numerous beasts of burden and setting them up elsewhere. The nomadic nature of the Musafir tribes and their distant travels have also given rise to a unique new opportunity, a rich new market of spice trading. Merchants laden with spices travel from one land to another, selling exotic spices for a hefty profit.
Over their long years and numerous leagues the people of Musafir have become master traders and skilled diplomats. As such it is little wonder that they are able to negotiate extremely favorable deals and contract mercenary companies cheaper than usual."
#summary "Race: Humans. Prefer Heat scale +1.  Can migrate entire settlements with all accompanying buildings, including forts, to other land. Can send trade caravans to friendly cities and even other nations for profit. Mercenaries cost 10 percent less. Nation starts with an extra 100 gold.
Military: Light infantry, light cavalry, archers. Sacred Guardians of the Oasis. Various types of caravans.
Magic: Fire, Air, Astral, some Death.
Priests: Moderate."

Initial attempts to sell the tainted beer were met with severe poisoning and reports of hallucinations and ghost sightings, at which point the remaining kegs were dumped on the streets where they eventually found their way to the ever-growing ghoul population which found the peculiar flavor of the beer inviting. Seeing a whole new potential market, the Markgraf jumped at the opportunity and rebranded his patented brew. The working conditions since the union accidents haven't improved much in the brewery and accidental drowning are still reported regularly." -- is a type of poison in itself hence reduce poisonres, those who drink think they halucinate ghosts, become a bit roudy, drunk morale, can only be stomacked by undead who are seemingly soothed by the poison

However, in time it appears as if the original Hammerers thought their hammers to be crude as they were often mistaken for smith apprentices. Looking for something more dignified, they worked with some local smiths, who definitely did want to be mistaken for the crude Hobmark Hammerers, to produce a hammer that both could strike through the skulls of the undead and an enemies plate mail while looking stylish.

The hammers were then called Louse Hammers. If one asks a Hammerer the answer would instead be that the hammers are the trademark of Luzern’s Fine Metal Wares which gives it its name, but as they are pretentious and snobby, it is obvious that the former origin of the name rings closer to the truth.

Though the Hoburghers generally lack an understanding and prowess in the arts of magic, some seem to still have an understanding for the art of Necromancy, perhaps due to their close association with the soil. A few years ago there was even a Hoburg Necromancer, Sigsimunda Strobel, at this very College, who was not without insight into the Dark Arts. Recently the Nekromants gained access to the Markgraf’s council, because they cooperated in finding a way to copy the Hoburg manufactures. Being well-versed in the art of preservation, one of the first manufactures to be populated sole by undead workers was the manufacture of ‘Hermann Flesher’s Fine Pickled Meats’. There were some complaints of fingers in the pickles, which pitched the Markgraf into a lengthy legal battle with the Fletcher family."

Nevertheless, some worrying reports talk about large amounts of armed and armored small skeletons among the graveyards in the Markgrafdom.

#descr "According to a certain ill-reputed doctor, the art of reviving someone is dependent on two factors - memory and hunger. At times a revived corpse will only retain its memory but no willpower in which case it becomes a ghost, none of its previous hungers drives it on and it is just a lingering. In the opposite case it is just the hunger driving it. As easily understood it is difficult to revive a hoburg and have the resulting corpse not be overwhelmed by hunger. The easiest way to let the subject of the revivification retain some memories would be to start the reanimation process just a few minutes before the subject dies. As such it is not a popular procedure, but lured by the promise of eternal life and eternal dinners, some of the markgrafs let themselves be talked into this by the nekromants."

Being bested in an election to the title of Burmeister, the ancestor of the current Markgraf decided to withdraw himself from the Hoburg society altogether, setting up his domain as that of a Graf, modeled on the human Barons. For a few generations this remote area of the Hoburg society was more or less self-sufficient, if a bit leaner than their neighbors. The Markgraf managed to live well off his subjects and no dissenters to his rule survived to tell any tales. Many Hoburgers of ill repute have found a refuge in the towns of the Markgrafdom, which had already broken with the customs of the Hoburg society. As the Markgraf’s domains are more barren and worn down than the rest the Hoburg lands, the Markgrafs have tried every means available to improve the lot of their subjects and themselves."

Spending the money earned from manufactures and settled lawsuits on research in order to investigate an old rumor in the Markgraf annals, he hoped to gain power for himself. We at the College of Cerebra Magni were happy to be able to present the results of our studies, which indicated that the Nekromant could aid the Markgraf in achieving a status of powerful undeath. The disadvantage being that he requires the blood of living people on a constant basis, though not necessarily that of Hoburghers. There are some uncertainties as to how he received our results, because the envoys that were sent with the results seem to have disappeared during their travels. However, the Markgraf has since paid the monies due and even offered a stipend for young scholars to travel to the Markgrafdom to study."

		#descr "Though the original vampiric Markgraf was rather limited in his resources, he retained the immense hunger of his kind. According to some bookkeeping that reached our College, the Markgraf seemed to have spent most of the revenues of his undead factories importing a steady run of black sausage, black pudding and fresh pig’s blood from their Hoburg neighbors. This in combination with a steady decline in population in the villages seems to indicate that the Markgraf tried to satiate his hunger with blood. Though no study by itself seems to indicate that an increased intake of blood would help developing vampiric abilities, at best it would placate an ordinary Vampire, while a regular Hoburgher would just be nauseated, if not full. The reason may instead be found in the fake blood produced by the Horticulturalist in order to water down the blood barrels. Though the herbal mixtures could not be shown to have provided any benefit in smaller amounts, or even normal amounts, it is possible that a high concentration of herbal mixture would make a difference."

#descr "Recently deceased bodies unnaturally animated into a state of false life, the soulless are often dressed in the clothes they died in. Soulless do not have any vital organs, but their bodies are in a state of decomposition, so they are easier to destroy than a wight or a lich. Soulless are often called zombies. They do not rout unless their master is killed. The soulless are mindless and will quickly dissolve if left without leadership on the battlefield."

In order to avoid the usual problem of lost body parts and sometimes the botched hunger of the undead, the Nekromants developed a ritual involving a graveyard, some strong Hoburg ale, incense and a very sweet pie to turn the twice dead into ghosts, separating their body from their soul. However, the scheme failed, because the ghostly remains could not be contained, and the Ghosts would bicker incessantly, forcing the Nekromants to move their premises."

Given that they even posses the abilities to create more ghosts, even without ale, incense, or a sweet pie; makes them especially annoying to the Nekromants."

#name "Markgrafdom"
#epithet "The Necrophagy"
#era 2
#descr "Markgrafdom is a remote and unwelcoming colony of the Hoburg society. It is a dreary and barren place ruled by the infamous Markgraf. The subjects of the Markgraf are a quiet and suspicious people. Strangers who come to visit will find that the doors are closed and no one will speak to them in the tavern. Markgrafdom is unlike any other Hoburg settlement and it has long since broken customs with the rest of the Hoburg society. Over the years it has become a hive of scum and villainy where all types of unsavory characters have found refuge, but chief among them the Nekromants - Hoburgers with an affinity for the necromantic arts. The aging Markgraf has seen the potential of using necromancy for his own ends and has put the Nekromants to all kinds of projects. Ever since, dark and foreboding rumors have started circulating about the Markgraf's ascension to godhood and the apparent ghoul epidemic that accompanied it.
The settlements of Markgrafdom are affected with a horrible curse. The Markgraf's rumored ascension has caused the surrounding lands to wither and succumb to decay. As the plague spreads the inhabitants of Markgrafdom fall deathly ill but do not die. Instead they slowly develop a ravenous desire for rotten flesh as they turn into ghouls. Though all lands under the Markgraf's domain are affected with the Curse, the plague spreads more rapidly in the tightly packed fortified settlements of Markgrafdom than in the open countryside."
#summary "Race: Hoburgs.
Military: Light and medium infantry, crossbows, light cavalry. All Hoburg units have a ghoul second shape upon death. Mages in ghoul form will receive +1 Death magic.
Magic: Nature, Water, Earth, Death.
Priests: Weak."
#brief " Markgrafdom is a remote area of Hoburg society, ruled by the Markgraf and his Nekromants. "

Before the Earth gems are cooled the armor is shaped to perfection. Creating a Golem at the Anvil of the Void while not having a Control Rod present can be a dangerous undertaking as there will be nothing to suppress the now deranged Golem's will. In the absence of a volunteer from the Warrior caste, a casteless dwarf is often taken instead."

#descr "All dwarves are known to posses Stone Sense, the ability that enables them to navigate themselves underground. Those of the Gifted caste are even said to be able to hear the song of the Stone, the progenitor of the dwarven race. With this powerful ritual the caster is able to enter into a communion with the Stone and use the bond to gradually sense rich gold veins in distant mountain provinces. The Stone's song will then open up a tunnel, allowing the Mining caste Prospectors to set up a rich gold mine within the mountain. This enchantment can only be used to sense gold veins within mountains in friendly dominion. If the bond between the caster and the Stone is severed, the tunnels created by the Stone will slowly collapse. As the gold veins are sometimes located very deep underground, tunnels to dangerous and unknown places may open up too."

#descr "Val Morhen is the ancestral home of the Smith and Mining Castes due to the rich ore deposits within their home. Much of Val Morhen's wealth comes from its mining. Various types of rare and precious metals are needed for the smiths and artificers of Val Morhen to create true masterworks. Ore Miners venture into the dwarven tunnels, always seeking rich, new veins from which to mine and smelts these ores from. Old dwarven folktale and stories speak of ancient horrors that were awoken by the dwarven miners and prospectors, deep beneath the crust of the earth that started a century-long struggle that eventually all but destroyed all of dwarven race. No such events are recorded in Stone by the Shapers of Memory, though if any such records ever even existed, they were most likely struck from the Shaperate a long time ago."

The dwarves are simply exceedingly skilled at extracting the precious stones and metal which can be found in abundance in the wide-spreading tunnels that run beneath the surface of the earth. The dwarven connection to the Stone is well documented and some dwarves from the mining caste have been known to find rich gold veins by ear. Gold mining is one of the most difficult facets of this caste's work, requiring finesse and a hearty dwarven constitution to withstand the harsh working conditions. The trade of this mineral generates a significant portion of Val Morhen's revenues and as such is vital to the dwarven society.

#descr "Smiths are a well-respected caste within Val Morhen, and children born to the Smith caste are expected to learn the craft as their ancestors did. Females in this caste may become smiths, though it would also be acceptable for them to marry and produce children for their caste.  Smiths often compete for acclaim and patronage. Within the caste Runesmiths, followed by Artificers are most revered. The Runesmiths of Val Morhen hold the knowledge of rune-crafting, the tightly-guarded process of imbuing weapons and armor with powerful magic and magical properties. This knowledge is secretly passed down from generation to generation between the Runesmiths, and is a means of preserving power and influence within the Smith caste, and indeed the dwarven society. 

Runesmiths of Val Morhen can enter the Rune Forges in order to craft powerful and sophisticated weapons and armor for Rune Guard warrior caste. The process of crafting such armaments is very difficult and demanding, and requires substantial funds. It costs as much as ten gold pieces to procure the ores needed, and ten gold pieces more to pay the Runesmiths' services in order to create even one set of rune weapons and armor. Due to the exorbitant price very few Rune Guard are chosen and honored with such powerful armaments.

To forge and equip Rune Guards with superior weapons and armor, a Runesmith must enter the Rune Forge site. No more than two of each Rune Guard type will be outfitted each month and the price for outfitting each soldier will be twenty gold coins."

#descr "Magical talent is not something Dwarves are inherently blessed with. Rare are those who posses any magical capabilities and even those who do often struggle to diversify or advance their magical knowledge. As dwarves experience a unique and all-encompassing relationship to their progenitor, the Stone, they are most proficient in Earth magic. Their connection to the Stone is so great that those with magical talent claim that they hear the Stone sing to them. Those rare dwarves who do posses magical talents belong to the Gifted caste. As dwarves from any caste, or even no caste, can exhibit magical talent all those who do are given to the Gifted caste. As such the Gifted caste holds dwarves that draw ancestry from all the other castes and as such hold varying degrees of influence within them all. The respectability of the Gifted caste, as well as the presence of those initially of  Noble caste within it grants the Gifted caste significant power, and as such they often vie for power against the Noble caste. All dwarves of magical talent perform spells by singing the Stone's song, however Runemasters are dwarves exceedingly attuned with the Stone and gifted at spellsinging, and are able to perform spells much faster than their brethren. 

Runemasters do not suffer from the spell singer slow casting penalty unlike other dwarves."

#descr "Most of the noble houses in Val Morhen are founded by Paragons, which give their name to their House. However, not all noble houses are descended from Paragons. Sometimes Warrior caste or Smith caste families become nobility through great deeds or other means. Paragons are the elite of the dwarven culture, the pinnacle of dwarven excellence, and the one exception to the rigid caste structure as they can be drawn from any caste, even the casteless. They are the noble warriors, politicians, smiths and even children that all others seek to emulate, and they function as essential role models to all dwarves. While dwarves do not worship gods as such, a Paragon is like a god in the eyes of dwarves which is attributed to the fact that the dwarves venerate their Ancestors, so a living Paragon is considered as a living Ancestor. The word of a Paragon surpasses in weight even the word of a king—even if the former's title does not grant official power. Dwarven cities are decorated by monolithic lifelike statues of Paragons from days past. There are few living Paragons as many dwarves are named Paragon only after their death. The act by which one becomes a Paragon can vary. Typically it is a feat of bravery in warfare or an incredible invention, but it can also be something as simple as embodying the ideals and tasks of one's caste to an unprecedented perfection. "

#descr "Deep beneath the mountains, in the last dwarven theig, a fierce battle was fought for the very survival of the dwarven race. Faced with extinction, the Artificers, Runesmiths, and Paragons of Val Morhen all desperately fought to invent a weapon capable of turning the tide of war. One that would triumph where all others had failed. Finally they succeeded in creating a magical forge called the Anvil of the Void where the first Golems were animated; hulking monstrosities hewn of stone and sheets of metal that were capable of pulverizing the Darkspaw and which could easily be directed by Control Rods from a safe distance. Legions of Golems were created and soon enough Val Morhen stood victorious in the crushed remains of Darkspawn. The triumph of Val Morhen came at a heavy cost however, as a dark secret emerged. Incapable of shaping and animating the Golems solely by magic, the Paragons resorted to a heinous crime, encasing living dwarves in a Golem suit and pouring molten gems though the eye holes, mouth hole, and joints of the armor. Before the molten Earth gems are cooled, the armor is hammered and shaped to perfection. The act itself produced volatile and crazed Golems that would more often slay their brethren than their enemies, so a Control Rod was fashioned to keep them obedient and servile, and their deranged will suppressed. As long as there is even a single commander wielding a Control Rod in the presence of Golems, they will remain servile, but should the shackles be broken, disaster may follow.

Unless there is a commander with a Golem Control Rod present, Dwarven Golem will rebel and attack the province. It is only possible to control up to ten Dwarven Golems in any single land at a time."

#descr "Deep in the mountains of Val Morhen exists one of the oldest and most fierce military organizations known to dwarves; the Legion of the Dead. Those who join the Legion undergo symbolic funerals where last goodbyes are spoken to friends and family and all ties to their former lives are cut. Henceforth, their fate is consigned and their lives used in service to the dwarven kingdom. Dead Legionaries venture forth to reclaim their once vast kingdom from all manners of foul creatures that now infest the underside of the mountains. The Legion was formed at the height of the Blight wars, and since its resolution has been steadily dwindling in number, with no immediate danger from the Darkspawn to bolster the Legion's ranks, though the dark dwarven tunnels and roads that run deep beneath the Earth's surface are still filled with all manners of creatures that still pose a significant danger. The life of a Dead Legionnaire is usually a hard, bloody, and short-lived one. Some last months, while others last for years before second death claims them, but claims them it does, and all meet the same, cold fate, far from the familiar caves of Val Morhen, in the dark and long-forgotten recesses of their once vast kingdom, trying to reclaim their glory and inheritance."

#name "Val Morhen"
#epithet "The Last Theig"
#era 2
#descr "Val Morhen, The Kingdom under the Mountain, is the last refuge of the dwarven race. It is the only theig, the only great city to have survived the Blight wars, a century long struggle that all but consigned the dwarven race to a distant memory.
The crumbling and eroding subterranean roads that once used to connect countless dwarven theigs across the land are now silent and dark. Once great feats of architecture of ingenious design and craftsmanship now lay collapsed and in ruin. Grim reminders of the once great and sprawling dwarven kingdoms decorate the undersides of the mountains. But Val Morhen still stands glorious and invictus, and bustling with the activity of the grim-faced dwarves. Fire-belching siege engines crawl about as various other contraptions and machines are being constructed. Great ore and gold mines keep production afloat as the Rune Forges of the great city echo with the banging and clanking of the Runesmiths' hammers, and the great Anvil of the Void still births indestructible rock monsters that keep vigil and protect the last great gates of the dwarven kingdom. Deep under the mountains, the Legion of the Dead marches out into the brooding dark, determined to reclaim the dwarven kingdom, and all its lost secrets and memory. Yet none speak of the horrid stench of death and decay that still fills the dwarven deep roads, or of the encroaching taint that spreads through the very earth, like a blight."
#summary "Race: Sturdy Dwarves. Partial darkvision and mountain survival. Can equip certain troops with superior armaments.
Military: Heavy Infantry, crossbows and arbalests. Towering siege engines and contraptions. Can equip Rune Guard with superior, magical weapons and armor.
Magic: Earth, Fire, some Air and Astral.
Priests: Moderate."
#brief "Val Morhen is the last dwarven theig. It is the last remnant of the once vast and sprawling kingdom. Siege engies, giant rock golems, and sturdy, grim-faced dwarves keep guard over the last great dwarven city, as the Legion of the Dead ventures forth to reclaim their destiny."

By melting down vast quantities of gold and then enchanting them, the Living Gold is created. It is an enormous mass of molten gold that exudes intense heat. Anyone standing too close to the Living Gold will get severely burnt. The Living Gold is extreemly slow due to it's high density and mass, however, those struck by it will get crushed under the weight of gold, and then melted into the mass as the inner temperature of the animated creature is immense. The Living Gold shrinks when damaged."

#descr "As a rule, women are prohibited from actively serving the army and joining the Golden Legions of Aurum, though there is no law that specifically prohibits women from training and owning arms. The Senate turns a blind eye and allows the women of the Republic the occasional whim as long as it keeps them from engaging in politics. As such, the women of the Republic are free to practice warfare in the temples of Aurum until marriage. The Aurumian war maidens are nicknamed harpies on account of the battle shrieks and ferocity with which they enter battle. Since they are not as strong as men or as well equipped on account of not being part of the army, they often train to fight in tight formation, using simple wooden shields and spears."

#descr "In the early days of the Republic many families rose to prominence practically overnight, fueled by the immense riches gained through conquest. Soon a trend was started among the patricians and high-born lords and ladies to display their newfound riches, which quickly turned into a competition of an outrageous display of wealth. But as the Republic continued to grow and expand, so did the competition. Palaces, temples, and entire legions were soon adorned with gold-platting, giving birth to the Republic's Golden Legions, but also its exorbitantly decadent reputation. It was not until a regiment of fierce high-born ladies in full golden battle gear appeared in front of the High Temple of Aurum in one of the numerous triumphal processions that the competition and the fad was ended, for the magical golden armor and weaponry could not be outdone and nothing could have possibly been more lavish and awe-striking than warrior maidens adorned in majestic pure golden armor and weaponry. A sacred order was formed then for the privileged high-born ladies, and the newly-named Golden Daughters of Aurum were freed of the usual social obligations to marry and bear children. Those who joined the order left behind their family names and became daughters of the Republic. Any sexual relationship with a citizen was therefor considered to be incestum and an act of treason harshly punished. Within their own order the Golden Daughters are given full autonomy and are even allowed to join the Golden Legion under special directive and command of the Consuls. Golden Daughters are sacred to the people of Aurum; doubly so by being both formidable warriors of the faith, and the daughters of the Republic and prominent patricians."

#descr "Magistrates are elected officials of the Republic tasked with enforcing the will of the Senate. The office of a Magistrate holds numerous, often vastly differing duties, and Magistrates frequently fill the roles of judges, lawmakers, administrators, scribes, and even generals. While anyone can become a Magistrate in the free, democratic Republic of Aurum, most, if not all Magistrates are typically elected from one of the wealthy and influential families of the patrician class. Though many Magistrates are loyal and devoted sons of the Republic, nepotism, corruption, and indolence are also wide-spread in the Republic's vast bureaucratic engine. Lofty and superfluous positions are often invented for the sons of influential and wealthy Senators, fraud and embezzlement is deep-rooted like a cancer, and scandals often shake the political scene.

In provinces where a Senate is established and maintained, Magistrates may be promoted to a higher office with more power and subsequently more responsibility. As the Republic grows so will its bureaucratic apparatus, and once a sufficient number of Magistrates are elevated to a higher rank, a Census will be held across the Republic, and a specialized office opened in the capital to keep track of the exact number of subjects in all the Republic's provinces. 

Some of the loyal sons of the Republic elevated to the position of a High Magistrate even end up using their influence and family wealth to approve and fund ambitious projects across the Republic.

Unlike mages, Magistrates are completely unaffected by either Magic or Drain scales and will neither suffer a penalty, nor receive a research bonus."

#descr "During the founding days of Aurum, when the Rexaurum - the Golden Kings, still ruled, the Senate served as little more than an advisory council to the kings. The overthrow of the last Golden King by a group of ambitious senators signalized the birth of the Republic. Over the coming years the Senate continued to gain power and assert itself until all legislative and executive power lay within the Senate. Its influence has grown to such proportion as to have a city without a Senate is unthinkable and an affront to the citizens and the spirit of the Republic.To stop any single Senator from amassing too much power and a return to the olden days of dictatorship, measures were installed. Once a Senator takes the office he is no longer allowed to directly and openly exert and spread his influence like regular patricians who often curry favors with the plebeian class by providing patronage or gifts for the purpose of gaining influence. Senators typically come from the wealthy patrician class, though it is not unheard-of for a commoner to be elevated to the rank of a Senator. 

A city must have at least five Senators to form a local Senate and maintain full legislative power within it. Once a year, during Spring, the capital Senate of Aurum will hold elections in order to appoint two Consuls from the ranks of the Senators, to defend the Republic and lead the Golden Legions of Aurum into war. 

Having five Senators in a fortified province will establish a Senate site. Provinces under 5k population do not require a Senate, though those with larger populations will demand one. Once a year, during Spring, the Senate will levy an additional tax and use portions of it to raise an army. The amount of troops raised will depend on how densely populated a province is."

Though the Republic recognizes only one official religion there is always an odd sect or two that needs rooting out before it takes hold. At time powerful Magistrates help hunt down such heretics and brigands, be those acts of devout followers of the official religion, or simply Magistrates seeking political gain though such actions."

#name "Magistrate"
#descr "Magistrates are elected officials of the Republic tasked with enforcing the will of the Senate. The office of a Magistrate holds numerous, often vastly differing duties and Magistrates frequently fill the roles of judges, lawmakers, administrators, scribes, and even generals. While anyone can become a Magistrate in the free, democratic Republic of Aurum, most, if not all Magistrates are typically elected from one of the wealthy and influential families of the patrician class. Though many Magistrates are loyal and devoted sons of the Republic, nepotism, corruption, and indolence are also wide-spread in the Republic's vast bureaucratic engine. Lofty and superfluous positions are often invented for the sons of influential and wealthy Senators; fraud and embezzlement is deep-rooted like a cancer; and scandals often shake the political scene. 

In provinces where a Senate is established and maintained, Magistrates may be promoted to a higher office with more power and subsequently more responsibility. As the Republic grows so will its bureaucratic apparatus, and once a sufficient number of Magistrates are elevated to a higher rank, a Census will be held across the Republic, and a specialized office opened in the capital to keep track of the exact number of subjects in all the Republic's provinces. 

Some Magistrates are nothing but a drain on the Republic's treasury, but there are those whose incompetence or malice threatens the stability of the Republic. However removing such individuals from office is not an easy task and carries its own risks and potential repercussions."

The influence that such citizens have on the Republic and the plebeian class can often be substantial, especially if the individual in question is a High Magistrate.

The monument is estimated to be hundreds of feet tall and its mesmerizing shine in full sunlight can even be seen from surrounding lands hundreds of leagues away. The Golden Hoplite is a testament to the Republic's vast power, but more importantly its renewed decadence and indolence as the wealth spent to erect the this golden colossus is all but immeasurable. Though the Republic seemingly grows greater day by day, the constant expansionist politics and wealth-seeking conquests needed to indulge such material frivolity are putting the Republic in grave danger."

During the coming years, two of the three great Consuls passed away and were from then on replaced by regular, yearly votes that elevated two Senators to the rank of the Consul via a democratic vote for a period of exactly one year that would serve to limit any potential accumulation of power and return to tyranny. However, as the long years passed, the most deserving of the three original Consuls continued to linger, seemingly unaffected by age. Soon he was named the Golden Consul for years in office brought the golden age of Aurum. Though the Golden Consul is credited as being the most famed general and tactician to have ever been born in Aurum, and a masterful magistrate and politician to boot, he has long-since willingly reclused himself from the Republic's affairs, rarely even choosing to venture out into the public's eye. Those more skeptical citizens speculate that the Golden Consul's retirement from political office and his unwillingness to command legions was secretly imposed by the Senate, worried that the first son of the Republic might eventually become its first Emperor were his influence left to spread to openly. 
In the later years, the Golden Consul has in a sense become something of a spiritual protector of the Republic, eternal as long as the Republic yet lives."

#name "Aurum"
#epithet "The Golden Republic"
#era 1
#descr "On the surface, the Republic of Aurum is known far and wide as a glorious golden republic where opulence and wealth permeate and seep into every aspect of society. Tales are told of high golden walls that adorn the palaces of the Republic, of patricians who compete in exhibitions of wealth and luxury, and of the numerous legions of Aurum that are seemingly clad in majestic and gleaming pure golden armor. Stories are told of golden goddesses clad in magical golden armaments that march alongside the legions of Aurum. Though the Republic might have once been nearly as incredible as the stories told, the truth now is far from reality, and nothing more than a well-maintained myth by the Senate which desperately tries to cling to power in the ever-declining Republic. The Republic's recent and numerous expansionist campaigns were motivated by massive debts and deficits in the now all but empty treasury. The Golden Legions of Aurum are little more than thinly gold-platted, or possibly even gold-painted armor, and the magical golden gear of Aurum nothing more than an expensive fabrication.
The Republic of Aurum is capable of establishing Senates and extending the reach of the Republic's great bureaucratic apparatus. The Senates possesses vast legislative powers and can even levy additional taxes, raise troops, or recklessly spend the hard-earned coin of the citizens. 
Yearly elections are held in the capital of Aurum where two Consuls are chosen from the ranks of many Senators to safe-guard the Republic from foreign invaders, and usher the nation into a new golden era."
#summary "Race: Human. Can construct 7 Wonders of the World through various High Magistrates.
Military: Human legionaries and faux-golden sacred warriors.
Magic: Fire, Water, Earth, Astral, Nature, Death.
Priests: Moderate, can heal afflictions."
#brief "Aurum is a golden republic where faux-golden legions continuously march into new conquests under the command of the Consuls and of the Senate in order to preserve the well-accustomed, lavish way of life in the Republic."

These lesser mages agreed to forgo their magical training in favor of mastering swordsmanship, an act considered debased and barbarian. Eventually, the Knights Arcane were formed. Over time they became as competent swordsmen as those of any realm. What little remained of their dwindling talents was used to teach them how to immobilize their enemies in close combat so that they might kill them all the easier. Nowadays, the Knights Arcane are formidable adversaries and few would dare to go toe to toe with them for even when outnumbered the Knights Arcane easily carry the day by using their magical abilities to level the playing field and immobilize a large part of the enemy force while fighting the other. Though the sacrifice the Knights Arcane made long ago was one of the main reasons the people of Edranor survived their persecution, little gratitude is shown to them today, for their lack of skill in wielding magic is considered an affront to the ideals of the society.

Though the abilities the Spellbinders possess are indeed incapable of directly killing their victims, they very often do so none the less, and are not as benign as the others consider them to be. The Spellbinders are capable of projecting powerful illusions and clouding the minds of their enemies, making them believe that an enemy soldier stands where but a second ago a friend stood, a trick that typically ends up disrupting and thinning enemy lines. The Spellbinders are the only ones of the ranks of the Venari that have remained true to their original purpose and name, a fact mildly ironic given that the ones who have remained true to their name have lost it in the process."

The Altus are capable of casting large bolts of fire that engulf all those hit in violent flames and set aflame all those unfortunate enough to be caught nearby as well. In their empowered forms, the Altus are even capable of casting down blazing lances of pure fire which instantly incinerate all those hit. The spell is so intense and powerful that it instantly incinerates everything it touches and burns away everything, including even the soul, leaving little more than shattered and blazing soul fragments in its wake.

As such, it is little wonder that these mages are widely rumored to be more demon in nature than human after the completion of the ritual. There are even those who think the Possessed indeed are demons, those that devoured the mage souls during the Harrowing and somehow found a link back to their corporeal bodies in the Terrestrial plane. Whatever the case may be, the Possessed truly do wield frightening demonic-like powers. Their abilities are grounded in Blood magic and vampirism. They are capable of projecting bolts of pure agony at their enemies that either leave them dead, or soon to be. The Possessed seemingly feed on the anguish of others and are reinvigorated by the screams and agony of those they slay. They can leech the life force of others to replenish themselves and even use their powers to open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. When seriously wounded in combat, and near death's door, the Possessed enter a type of blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to fuel their magical abilities all the more. Once in such a state the Possessed are capable of draining the life force of those they've wounded in order to instantly heal themselves. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous killing cuts and wound only to literally rip apart their enemies in the ensuing blood frenzy and emerge unscathed. Much like all mages of Edranor, the abilities of the Possessed are also fueled by physical strength and the deep well of hatred and vengeance."

It is while searching for this arcane secret that the Dreamers accidentally uncovered the Dreamlands, a transcendental plane of existence. Now, the Dreamers spend all their waking hours in the Void Chamber, which incidentally grow fewer and fewer all the time as the Dreamers have no interest in the physical world, instead choosing to spend the majority of their lives exploring the Dreamlands and trying to ascend to higher planes of existence. As such, it is little wonder that the physical bodies of the Dreamers are atrophied and often too weak to even leave the Void Chamber after suffering prolonged bouts of Dreamwalking and years of neglect from their owners, despite having been endowed with the same strength like all others who pass the Harrowing. Many of those who return from the Dreamlands often find their frail and abandoned bodies weakened even more from the prolonged neglect, now pilled with afflictions. While navigating the Dreamlands, the Dreamers remain completely invisible until they manifest to yank their unsuspecting victims into the Dreamlands with them. However, spending too much time in the Dreamlands can be very dangerous and is guaranteed to attract unwanted attention for the Dreamlands are a living place and will sense those who trespass.

This great spire was created by the Dreamers long ago, while still trying to rediscover the long lost secret of Ascension in an effort to prevent the remaining people of Edranor from being slaughtered. It is while searching for this arcane secret that the Dreamers accidentally uncovered the Dreamlands, a transcendental plane of existence. Now, the Dreamers spend all their waking hours in the Void Chamber, which incidentally grow fewer and fewer all the time as the Dreamers have no interest in the physical world, instead choosing to spend the majority of their lives exploring the Dreamlands and trying to ascend to higher planes of existence. As such, it is little wonder that the physical bodies of the Dreamers are atrophied and often too weak to even leave the Void Chamber after suffering prolonged bouts of Dreamwalking and years of neglect from their owners, despite having been endowed with the same strength like all others who pass the Harrowing. Many of those who return from the Dreamlands often find their frail and abandoned bodies weakened even more from the prolonged neglect, now pilled with afflictions. While navigating the Dreamlands, the Dreamers remain completely invisible until they manifest to yank their unsuspecting victims into the Dreamlands with them. However, spending too much time in the Dreamlands can be very dangerous and is guaranteed to attract unwanted attention for the Dreamlands are a living place and will sense those who trespass. Dreamers are few in number and are often considered mad by the mages of Edranor. Most of those who join their ranks also seem to be male, eluding that perhaps the rational mind takes precedence for Dreamwalking than one ruled by the maelstrom of emotions."

#name "Avatar of Vengeance"
#descr "When the Dreamers failed to rediscover the means of ascension, all hope for leading the people of Edranor from the brink of ruin was lost. In a last act of defiance the people of Edranor turned away from ascension and escape for good and settled for vengeance. In a grand and bloody ritual, which would later be known as the very first Harrowing, the mages of Edranor invaded the Demon Realms, and acquired the means of vengeance. Most of those who attempted the first Harrowing died either in the crossing, or while facing the demonic spirits, but the few survivors who made it back acquired incredible demonic powers and became the very avatars of vengeance and retribution. It is by unleashing their unadulterated fury and rage that the people of Edranor found their salvation for the second time in history. Ever since, the Harrowing has become a coming of power rituals all mages undergo at one point or other. Though it was never made mandatory, it is unheard of for someone not to attempt it, for the price of power is well known and gladly paid. Avatars of Vengeance are the ones who know it best and who have payed the heaviest price. The vast and mysterious powers of the Avatars of Vengeance are a closely held secret. In truth, the Avatars are not fully human. Not all emerge from the Harrowing equally. Some mages are faced with lesser demons of limited powers, and some are faced with greater ones. Some are even plunged so deep into the Demon Realm that they lose all hope of returning to their corporeal bodies in time, regardless of the powers acquired. And then there are those that would become the Avatars of Vengeance, the mages that would not only take the vanquished demon's power and strength, but also devour its heart, absorbing the demon within themselves and thus gaining powers not akin to most. When an Avatar of Vengeance emerges from the Harrowing she is watched very closely for many weeks and executed if the tiniest influence of the demon within is detected."

#descr "The Manifestation is a demonic spirit unleashed from its prison, the body of an Avatar of Vengeance, through one last act of sacrifice.Though finally freed in the Terrestrial Sphere, the envious Manifestation will continue to emulate its former keeper and take on her characteristics and mannerisms, wishing to become her. The difference between the demon and the Avatar can indeed be negligible, especially considering the violent proclivities of the Avatars gladly shared by their demonic inhabitants; an unsettling fact not easily accepted and the main reason the choices made during the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secret that could potentially cause a rift within Edranor itself. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, who made it their identity, so will the Manifestation take that mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor.

The difference between the demon and the Avatar can indeed be negligible, especially considering the violent proclivities of the Avatars gladly shared by their demonic inhabitants; an unsettling fact not easily accepted and the main reason the choices made during the Harrowing rituals by the Avatars are a closely guarded secret that could potentially cause a rift within Edranor itself. As the Avatars of Vengeance were no simple mages during their life, but mages that embodies the concept of Vengeance, who made it their identity, so will the Manifestation take that mantle, becoming the vengeful demonic spirit of Edranor.

There are even those who think the Possessed indeed are demons, those that devoured the mage souls during the Harrowing and somehow found a link back to their corporeal bodies in the Terrestrial plane. Whatever the case may be the Possessed truly do wield frightening demonic-like powers. Their abilities are grounded in Blood magic and vampirism. They are capable of projecting bolts of pure agony at their enemies that either leave them dead, or soon to be. The Possessed seemingly feed on the anguish of others and are reinvigorated by the screams and agony of those they slay. They can leech the life force of others to replenish themselves and even use their powers to open gashing cuts upon scores of enemies at once through sheer willpower and hatred. When seriously wounded in combat, and near death's door, the Possessed enter a type of blood frenzy, their flowing wounds now used to fuel their magical abilities all the more. Once in such a state a Possessed is capable of draining the life force of those he cuts in order to instantly heal himself. There are many frightening tales of the Possessed suffering numerous killing cuts and wound only to literally rip apart their enemies in the ensuing blood frenzy and emerge unscathed. Much like all mages of Edranor, the abilities of the Possessed are also fueled by physical strength and the deep well of hatred and vengeance."

#descr "When the Dreamers failed to rediscover the means of ascension, all hope for leading the people of Edranor from the brink of ruin was lost. In a last act of defiance the people of Edranor turned away from ascension and escape for good and settled for vengeance. In a grand and bloody ritual, which would later be known as the very first Harrowing, the mages of Edranor invaded the Demon Realms, and acquired the means of vengeance. Most of those who attempted the first Harrowing died either in the crossing, or while facing the demonic spirits, but the few survivors who made it back acquired incredible demonic powers and became the very avatars of vengeance and retribution. It is by unleashing their unadulterated fury and rage that the people of Edranor found their salvation for the second time in history. Ever since, the Harrowing has become a coming of power rituals all mages undergo at one point or other. Though it was never made mandatory, it is unheard of for someone not to attempt it, for the price of power is well known and gladly paid. Avatars of Vengeance are the ones who know it best and who have payed the heaviest price. The vast and mysterious powers of the Avatars of Vengeance are a closely held secret. In truth, the Avatars are not fully human. Not all emerge from the Harrowing equally. Some mages are faced with lesser demons of limited powers, and some are faced with greater ones. Some are even plunged so deep into the Demon Realm that they lose all hope of returning to their corporeal bodies in time, regardless of the powers acquired. And then there are those that would become the Avatars of Vengeance, the mages that would not only take the vanquished demon's power and strength, but also devour its heart, absorbing the demon within themselves and thus gain powers not akin to most. When an Avatar of Vengeance emerges from the Harrowing she is watched very closely for many weeks and executed if the tiniest influence of the demon within is detected."

The Altus hold the secret of the Bleeding Fire, a spell that empowers those that would attempt the Harrowing, making it easier for them to overcome the demons and join the ranks of the Altus. This secret, however, is rarely put to use for exposing such a secret to any potential candidate can be very risky and the spell itself requires the use of magical gems which are not easy to come by."

#descr "With this ritual a Dreamer is able to enter the Dreamlands and leave his physical body behind in the Void Chamber. While in the Dreamlands the Dreamer is capable of instantaneously traversing impossible distances across the known world and pulling their unsuspecting victims into the Dreamlands with them in an attempt to assassinate them. The Dreamers posses strange arcane knowledge and are able to safely traverse the Dreamlands. Should they die in the Dreamlands they will simply awaken in the Void Chamber, ready to delve into the dreams once again, though traversing the Dreamlands is not without risk and will doubtlessly attract unwanted attention that could follow the Dreamers back into the Terrestrial Sphere. Dreamers are incapable of remaining in the Dreamlands for extended periods of time as their astral forms slowly but surely deteriorate over time, losing cohesion, until they are expelled from the Dreamlands altogether."

Unlike Dreamwalking, traversing the Transcendental Plane of Thought is free of risk and will not attract unwanted attention from otherworldly horrors as the Dreamers are capable of assuming the forms of ascendant beings themselves while there. Much like in the Dreamlands their forms in the Transcendental Plane of Thought will deteriorate over time."

-- Harrowing ---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

#newspell
#name "The Harrowing"
#descr "The Harrowing is a ritual in which an Initiate's spirit is projected into the Demon Realm for a very short duration in an effort to attract a demonic entity. Demons are jealous creatures, envious of humans and the Terrestrial sphere. Even though they can manifest in any form they please, in their own domain they will still take the form of the mage they seek to devour, hoping to become them and take their place. Once faced with the demon, the Initiate will attempt to kill the fiend and take its powers for her own, merging the essence of the demon with that of herself, or die trying. Those who undergo the Harrowing are first forced to relive the most tragic events of their lives, reminding them of all the pain and suffering they've endured so far and reminding them of why the ritual must be performed. The Harrowing is an incredibly dangerous ritual and more often than not an Initiate who attempts to undergo it will perish, despite the numerous years of training, leaving behind but an empty husk, splayed across the floors of the Blood Spire. However, those who do survive survive it emerge from the ritual empowered and with renewed and seemingly endless wells of motivating hatred for outsiders. The Harrowing can be undergone just once, for any mages who tries to attempt it a second time will either die outright or find themselves permanently stuck in the Demon Realm, unable to return to their corporeal bodies in the Terrestrial Sphere. 
The duty of initiating the Harrowing falls to the Avatars of Vengeance as well as the responsibility to slay the enslaved bodies of those Initiates who fail it, and end up possessed. The Harrowing is traditionally performed only once a month, and no more than one Initiate may undergo it."
#details "An Avatar of Vengeance must cast this ritual. Only those initiates with 12 or more experience points are eligible to undergo it. To select the Initiate meant to take the Harrowing choose one that has already been promoted and change shape into a form which lack item slots.

Any Initiate who undergoes the Harrowing will have a 40 % chance to transform into an Altus Arcane, 40 % chance to transform into a Venari Arcane, and 20 % chance to transform into an Avatar of Vengeance.

This ritual can be cast only once per turn, and no more than a single Initiate will be able to undergo it. Edranor must be in full control of the province for the ritual to have effect.

Those who undergo the Harrowing will be put in a mirror duel and will face the form they transform into in battle."

There is no mistaking the borders of Edranor, for every corner of their land is marked by the imposing and numerous Blood Obelisks which act as temples in their own right. They are the instrument through which Edranor spreads dominion over the lands, and by performing sadistic and unspeakable rituals the Blood Obelisks can be made to pulsate with a dark, blood-red colour and hum with the agonizing screams of all those the mages of Edranor have taken vengeance upon. Though the mages of Edranor are no more cruel than needed when the situation arises, they are also completely without compassion and indiscriminate in their judgement. They will not hesitate to slaughter a whole city if they have been wronged in some perceived manner, but will not turn their anger to those undeserving of it. 

As a result of their torment-riddled history, the mages of Edranor have become extremely xenophobic. Roughly one percent of population will be killed each month in every land owned by Edranor where hostile dominion still holds sway until the local population is fully pacified. The hostile dominion will be reduced at a rate of on average one candle per three months, though it will not automatically turn to friendly on its own.

--The Healing Blood is the source of power of the Healing Church. 
--It is capable of purging all afflictions to those it is administered 
--to and is the reason why so many outsides come to the Healing Church for 
--its miraculous cure. However, those who receive the Healing Blood experience 
--vivid hallucinations of a bloody beast crawling towards them, something discarded 
--as a bad dream by those of the Healing Church who administer the blood. It is around 
--the same time that the scourge of the beast first appeared when administration of the 
--Healing Blood became widespread. Those to whom the blood was administered slowly started 
--turning into monstrous beasts. Growing in size and becoming mad and delusional these beastly 
--men would roam and streets killing those not yet infected. Though the Healing Church was well 
--aware of the side effects of their blood ministration, outsides were blamed for the spreading 
--of the beastly plague.

Though the healing proportion of the Blood are undeniable, it also seems to exhibit a certain taint."

The heart will continue to beat and pulse with unbearable agony during each contraction well past death, following its owner into any afterlife, relentlessly tormenting him, for an eternity. Due to the trans-dimensional properties of the Beating Heart, it will act as a beacon, easily perceivable by otherworldly horrors that feed on strife and anguish.

The presence of the Beating Heart in the province will turn a Pain Amplifier into an Amplifier of Agony during the creation of the magic site. It will not transform any currently existing Pain Amplifiers however."

#selectnation 162
#name "Edranor "
#epithet "Ten Thousand Spires"
#era 2
#descr "The powers of the mages of Edranor were well known across the lands. But though they were vast and astounding, their numbers were few and slow to increase, unlike those of the surrounding barbarian hordes that multiplied as quickly as weeds and were just as hard to eradicate. Fearful of the arcane powers of Edranor, the various barbaric tribes of old united in an attempt to perform genocide. Faced with overwhelming numbers, the mages of Edranor were forced to concede their lands, city by city, until they were brought to the very brink of ruin. It is then that a portion of mages attempted an ascension ritual in order to escape their seemingly inevitable deaths. Many mages ascended to a higher plane of existence but many more were left behind, now truly desperate and lost. Those that failed to ascend found themselves abandoned and were forced to flee in an effort to survive. Many years they spent on the run, their numbers ever dwindling until all hope was lost. It is then that the first Harrowing was undergone and the means of salvation, and indeed retribution, was discovered. Now, Edranor is a growing empire intent on collecting the long-owed debts in blood. The powers of the mages of Edranor are anchored in emotions, primarily those of hate, vengeance, and pain. As such, female mages are much more adept at wielding and practicing this particular brand of magic than males are, and as such hold the reigns of the society. 
The people of Edranor have learnt to pay a heavy price for their powers and survival. Blood Hunting is accepted much more readily by the local population than in other lands. Their strife-filled history has made the mages of Edranor exceptionally xenophobic for they will continue to pacify the local population of friendly provinces until enemy dominion is completely removed. Roughly one percent of population will be killed each passing month and dominion reduced at a rate of one candle per three months."
#summary "Race: Spell-casting humans. Reduced unrest while Blood Hunting, up to 5 points per province. Dominion conflict bonus +1.
Military: A nation of mages who for the most part use spells instead of conventional weapons. Troops use enchanted robes instead of armor.
Magic: Fire, Air, Astral, Blood.
Priests: None. Preaching and temples have no effect. Dominion is spread via Blood Obelisks which are activated by spells.
Pretenders can be recalled by Blood Obelisks which have an equivalent power of H1."
#brief "A nations of mages whose powers come from demonic sources and are fueled by vengeance. They do not use conventional weapons but spells, rather. The mages of Edranor are very powerful, though fewer in number than other human nations."

The entire world is in peril as the Void Pulse slowly shatters the barrier that separates this world from the Void. Once activated, the effects of the Void Marker cannot be stopped any other way short of destroying the Void artifact. Diamedulla must be stopped before the effects of the Void Pulse become irreparable and the encroaching Void devours the whole of the world, leaving nothing but horrors and madness in its wake. 

Each month the device is active will bring the world closer to the Void, tainting it, and drawing the attention of otherworldly horrors. Madness will continue to seep into the world from the Void until the whole of the world is as mad as those of Diamedulla who caused this misfortune."

#msg "The end of the world is nigh! The mad alchemists of Diamedulla have finally figured out a way to activate theConvergence Sphere, one of the three main components of the Void Marker, and by far the most dangerous. The entire world is in grave danger as the Convergence Sphere begins to exert world-wide influence, causing rampant mutations and death across the world. More and more people begin to die from strange, cancerous growths and sickening mutations. Those who die do not stay dead for long as their bodies continue to change and transform even onto death, until they eventually rise up as horrifying abominations, the Necromorph.

Once activated, the effects of the Convergence Sphere cannot be stopped any other way short of destroying the Void artifact. Unless Diamedulla is stopped, everyone in the entire world will soon be turned into a sickening abomination!

Sages and Wise Men speculate that magical domes could perhaps be used to hold the worse of the artifact's effect at bay and stop those under its protection from turning into unspeakable monstrosities."

#descr "When the secret order of the Black Alchemists finally reveled themselves and lead a bloody revolution against the Imperium, the proletariat, the simple workers of Antikythera were promised a wonderful, glorious future; a higher purpose, an escape from the menial clockwork factories. The idyllic future envisioned by the Black Alchemist for the proletariat turned out to be closer to a nightmare, as is often the case in revolutions. Though the working conditions of the average working man have not deteriorated too significantly since the splintering of the Imperium, the working people of Diamedulla do live in an ever present fear under the rule of the Black Alchemist and their cultist-like disciples. Those that are observed to under-perform in their accorded duties, or those that seem to express doubts or criticisms of any kind simply vanish in the middle of the night along with their entire families. The people of Diamedulla have been restrained of many basic freedoms once taken for granted. Even death does not offer peace and a chance to finally rest as the monstrous Collectors appear to take away the bodies of the recently deceased as soon as word of passing spreads. Indeed, not reporting on such matter has even been deemed a criminal offense recently."

As Diamedulla lacks conventional, professional soldiers to protect its borders, but has no such lack of unskilled laborers, a desperate solution was sought to turn simple workers into skilled, or rather efficient soldiers. The end result of such experiments were Jarheads, soldiers whose entire bodies, apart from their heads, were replaced with metallic exoskeletons and outfitted with various weapons.

Jarheads come in a variety of forms which are selected at random upon recruitment."

Many technological breakthroughs were stolen by the Black Alchemists and then adapted to better combat their former comrades. One such breakthrough was the creation of the Noxious Breath, the Diamedullan variant of the Flamethrower. Unlike the Firebots of the Imperium of Antikythera, who use heavy plate armoring with think insulation against heat, the Noxious Infantry of Diamedulla use simple and cheap leather armor, alchemically enhanced to protect against poison. Though such light armor did little to protect from either the flamethrowers of Antikythera, or many of its many other deadly weapons, the comparatively low costs needed to create a Noxious Breath and protective gear more than made up for it. 
Though the Noxious Infantry is still largely unmodified, unlike the majority of the Diamedullan units, they still use 'head jars', containers placed over their head which further help protect against the inherent dangers of the weapons they use. Still, even such precautions can prove insufficient at times, when operating the Noxious Breath."

#descr "The practice of creating something more than human, but also less, didn't start in Diamedulla but Antikythera, rather, where attempts were made to combine man and clockwork machine. First, metallic prostheses were used on veterans of war, to help ease their lives, but then as the technology progressed men began to integrate more and more clockwork parts into themselves, disregarding their own limbs in favor of more durable, metallic ones. Such clockwork soldiers eventually proved extreemly effective in Antikytheran wars.Though Diamedulla has since reached much greater heights, or possibly fallen much lower in their research of human anatomy and the physical limits of the human body; all of the research is still based on the original sins of Antikythera which began the horrible practice that would inevitable lead to the creation of all of Diamedulla's horrors. An Amalgamation is one of such horrors. It is a spider-like creature composed of numerous metallic limbs, capable of trampling lesser creatures under it, and even scaling walls."

Due to their rather disturbing and sickening origins, the Flesh Golems are utterly raving mad and horrifying to behold. The Flesh Golems were initially designed to serve as assassins due to their versatile skill set, however the unintended consequence of their raving madness makes them less than ideal assassins, unpredictable and prone to fits of extreme violence and bloodlust.

In such a state a Viral Emissary will infect all those he comes in close contact with, turning them into twisted Nercomorphs. 

The presence of preaching Virulent Emissaries in infectious forms will spread an outbreak of Necromorphs from the Viral Horrors in any land they're present. The infection will spread as long as there is a preaching Viral Emissary and an established Viral Horror. Successfully establishing a well-hidden Viral Temple in any land may take the Viral Emissary two to four months. Once a accelerated mutation is triggered by the Virulent Emissary, the process cannot be reversed. Eventually, even the Virulent Emissaries themselves will succumb to the potency of the infection that they carry and die, though such a martyr's fate is gladly accepted by all."

#descr "The Collectors themselves are the end results of horrifying and ungodly experimentation. They are the boogeymen of Diamedulla, the monsters which wait under your bed to snatch and take you away and do unspeakable, unbearable things. Collectors often stalk individuals suspected of possessing rare traits or abnormalities. Such unfortunates are often taken under the cover of night and brought back to one of the numerous Diamedullan labs for further testing and experimentation.
At times, large-scale experiments are also conducted by the Collectors on unsuspecting population. Many people are abducted during the night, never to be seen or heard from again. At times, entire villages have been known to simply vanish without a trace. Such experiments are typically conducted covertly and far in between, less word of the disappearances spreads, causing too much unrest and driving potential test subjects into hiding, thereby hindering the successfulness of future experiments.

Collectors are capable of initiating 'experiments' through one of their innate abilities. By doing so they will attempt to locate and capture a mutated subject at the cost of some unrest and population death."

Unwilling subjects - for no other kind could possibly exist - are submerged inside the viscous fluids of the sack. Once a subject has been sealed inside the sack; long, metallic spines are then inserted, spines which connect to a vat of preservative fluids where something slithering and with far too many tentacles and sickening, fleshy protuberances is contained. Those unfortunate individuals sealed inside the Spawning Sack will mutate at an accelerated speed over a course of weeks and will emerge as inhuman monstrosities known as Necromorphs, leaving room for others to be placed inside in a repeat process.
The creature contained within the vat is an aberration created by the Void Marker. A simple individual who was affected by the insidious hum of the Marker to a much higher degree than is normal, causing him to mutate into something completely non-human and tumorous-looking.

#descr "Flesh Carvers are the ingenious, or perhaps more fittingly twisted minds behind most of Diamedullas inventions. They bring the Black Alchemists' visions to life, if indeed the embodiment of such horrifying visions can even be considered life, and not a perversion or mockery of it. The gruesome laboratories of the Flesh Carvers are typically set up in secret underground facilities, better to mask the smell of dried blood and rotting corpses, and quell the ever present screams of their latest test subjects. Unlike the alchemists of Diamedulla, the Flesh Carverns are not mad, at least not in any conventional sense. They simply enjoy the ghoulish work they do, and unfortunately for the people of Diamedulla, are exceptionally good at it."

Mad Alchemists will slowly lose their mind as time passes due to the influence the Void Marker exerts on those near it.

#descr "The Black Alchemists are the mad, abusive fathers of Diamedulla. They are those alchemists of Antikythera who either fell victim to the Void Marker's influence or were completely and utterly captivated by it. Black Alchemists are obsessed with the study of the Void Marker. Indeed, their obsession was so high that it caused a civil war. Once the Void Marker was first discovered in Antikythera and put to study, the strange properties of the artifacts were soon made evident, that those in its proximity would slowly succumb to insanity, their minds warped and twisted in unimaginable ways. It is then that a decision was made to destroy the Void Marker before its damage became irreparable, but those alchemists already fascinated by it and the secrets it might hold, or perhaps simply already mad from its influence, rebelled and lead a revolution that would eventually break the Imperium in two after much bloodshed and destruction. Whether Black Alchemists were always somewhat mad even in Antikythera, their madness simply veiled under a thin veneer of eccentricity often associated with the profession, or whether they indeed went mad from interacting with the Void Marker is unknown and ultimately irrelevant.

Black Alchemists will slowly lose their mind as time passes due to the influence the Void Marker exerts on those near it.

#descr "The Viral Containment Tank contains a specimen which possesses a very rare trait. It is capable of causing powerful and rampant, yet stable mutations in those directly infected by it. It is still unknown exactly what traits and characteristics are requisite in a subject for successful transformation as some experiments seem to succeed remarkably, while others, with a seemingly identical group, on occasion fail to produce almost any results. Whatever the case may be, a successful experiment does seem to require a critical biomass. Typically, around one hundred Workers are needed for a successful experiment, sometimes less, and sometimes more, depending on the quality of the subjects themselves. Once infected, these Workers will rapidly mutate and merge - often violently, piercing and slashing at each other and growing into the bodies of those impaled - into a new class of Necromorphs called Necrobrutes due to their imposing size. A successful experiment will produce anywhere between fifteen and thirty Necrobrutes, often leaving a few excess Zombified Workers in their midst as well.

From then on, their sole purpose seems to become creating more infected bodies and horrifying creatures. With the help of a Parasyte, the twisted Black Alchemists are capable of restarting mutations in several Necromorphs each month as reintroducing Necromorphs to lab conditions safely can be an arduous and time-consuming process.

This rather fascinating trait makes them excellent research subjects as they can withstand countless vivisections and experimental procedures. The research conducted on these specimens has made it possible to replicate their mutation and create the Necrotic Spines. Though such attempts seem to be directly tied to the strength of the Void Marker's influence in the given lab. The stronger the dominion of the Void Marker in the lab, the easier it will be to create Necrotic Spines, though it still remains a difficult and slow procedure regardless.

#descr "Given free reign, and an endless supply of test subjects, the twisted scientific minds of Diamedulla have invented many horrifying devices over the years. Perhaps the most sickening of such horrors are the Recombinant, those miserable souls impaled on strange devices called 'Dragon's Teeth'. Though impaled, these poor souls somehow remain alive and fully conscious for an extreemly long time, while slowly being twisted and turned into abominations over a course of agonizing weeks, or even months, by the same impaling device through vile black alchemy. 
Dragon's Teeth are typically placed on Diamedullan borders, or in front of their secretive fortification to ward off intruders. When approached, the impaling devices will slowly release the Recombinant while also injecting them with one last compound, the final, cruel touch of their deranged creators. Once released, the Recombinant will charge at their enemies and, once close enough - or near death, give off a powerful alchemical explosion, killing those nearby or immobilizing them with foul fumes for other Recombinant to more easily rip them apart. Fully transformed Recombinant do not retain any vestiges of their former personalities and are just mindless, empty husks."

#descr "Given free reign, and an endless supply of test subjects, the twisted scientific minds of Diamedulla have invented many horrifying devices over the years. Perhaps the most sickening of such horrors are the Recombinant, those miserable souls impaled on strange devices called 'Dragon's Teeth'. Though impaled, these poor souls somehow remain alive and fully conscious for an extreemly long time, while slowly being twisted and turned into abominations over a course of agonizing weeks, or even months, by the same impaling device through vile black alchemy. 
Dragon's Teeth are typically placed on Diamedullan borders, or in front of their secretive fortification to ward off intruders. When approached, the impaling devices will slowly release the Recombinant while also injecting them with one last compound, the final, cruel touch of their deranged creators. Once released, the Recombinant will charge at their enemies and, once close enough - or near death, give off a powerful alchemical explosion, killing those nearby or immobilizing them with foul fumes for other Recombinant to more easily rip them apart. Fully transformed Recombinant do not retain any vestiges of their former personalities and are just mindless, empty husks."

#descr "The Void Marker gradually erodes the minds of all those in its proximity, driving them quite mad and crippling their intellectual abilities over time. As such, it is little wonder any progress made on the artifact is typically painfully slow and its mysteries seemingly impossible to unclock. Due to this quite literally maddening obstacle, a device was created, one that could conduct the research unhindered and not fall pray to the Marker's insidious influence. 
The Deciphering Engines are towering machines created by the Black Alchemists to aid the research of the Void Marker. Due to their enormous size only one such engine can be operated from any single laboratory. Each Deciphering Engine constructed will add to the progress made on uncovering all of the Void Marker's secrets. The more laboratories there are with Deciphering Engines, the faster the research will be conducted. So far, the Mad Alchemists have ascertained that the Void Marker can directly perform at least three separate, distinct functions, though it yet remains a mystery as to what those functions may be."

Though Void Alchemy cannot hold insanity at bay, it is more than capable of alleviating the worst of it. Unfortunately, many Mad Alchemists and Black Alchemists refuse to practice Void Alchemy for they do not consider themselves to be mad, and thus in need of it. Void Alchemy is not without some small, inherent risk as the ritual can be very straining on the body. Those of old age may suffer afflictions while performing it, or even expire."

The success rate of such a complicated and unorthodox procedure - even for Diamedullan standards - is nowhere close to guaranteed and as such roughly 30% of subjects are lost during the procedure, or within the first few weeks. This type of head transplant procedure is exceedingly difficult as it is never performed on living subjects as is the practice, but rather as a fail safe to attempt to preserve, or rather revive Black Alchemists who have died to unforeseen circumstances.
Though decapitating subjects and transplanting their heads onto various other beings or constructs is a common practice in Diamedulla, doing so on already dead subject, possibly days after, not so much. Only the Black Alchemists are privy to such secrets and they guard them closely."

#name "Diamedulla"
#epithet "Scions of Madness"
#era 3
#descr "Diamedulla is a new empire, a twisted offspring of the Antikytheran Imperium built upon countless corpses and a river of blood, but most importantly madness. It is an empire centered around a mysterious Void artifact known as the Void Marker. Indeed, it was the discovery of this strange object that gave rise to Diamedulla, or rather the forming of the Void cults that would eventually spark a revolution and bring the entire Imperium to its knees. 
By the time the insidious properties of the Void Marker were made known to the Technomancers of Antikythera, the damage had already been done. Madness had already spread among the ranks of those who had investigated the strange artifact, initially covered under a veil of eccentricity that typically accompanied the Alchemists of Antikythera, those mages who came into contact with the Void Marker the most. It was not until an attempt to destroy the Void Marker was made by the Technomancers that many of the now mad Alchemists rebelled. 
The ensuing civil war would inevitably end in the splintering of Antikythera and the rise of a new empire ruled by the mad victors. Those who would stop at nothing to ensure their twisted vision was fulfilled for the good of all. As such it is little wonder that life in Diamedulla is far from idyllic. Indeed, what the mad envision as paradise is a grim reality for those with a sliver of sanity, though such people seem to be in ever shorter supply in Diamedulla as the insidious effects of the Void Marker continue to erode the minds of all those in it. Horrifying experiments are now secretly conducted on the working people of Diamedulla. Many a worker goes to bed only to wake up strapped to an operating table under the intense scrutiny of a Flesh Carver holding grisly instruments, or even creatures. Whispers of secret, underground laboratories and ungodly abominations spread across the empire."
#summary "Race: Augmented humans.
Military: Various slave workers, hybrid heavy infantry, tramplers, towering goliaths of flesh and metal, mortars and gas weapons.
Magic: Earth, Astral, Death, Blood
Priests: Weak."
#brief "Diamedulla is a newly created empire built on countless corpses and a river of blood. It is a nightmarish land that has fallen under the insidious and warping influence of the strange Void artifact known as the Void Marker. Madness rules supreme in Diamedulla, quite literally. It is a place where sickening and unimaginable experiments are performed on the unwilling population, and where horrifying abominations are created under the guidance of its rulers."

#descr "Mirrors can do more than hold bound magic and images within them. Skilled Illusionists can use them to observe and spy on distant lands, communicate over vast distances, and even as a means of travel. Great Mirrors are mostly used by garrison commanders to relay information and keep the great Mirror Tower apprised of any developing situations in distant lands. In times of peril the Great Mirrors are used to remotely direct illusions on the battlefield and offer sage advice from skilled commanders."

Guarded by a host of giants donned in mesmerizing armor polished to a mirror shine, the tower is home to many a Illusionist constantly practicing the art. Under a regular barrage of deceptive magic, the tower changes its appearance daily, sometimes even hourly. In the morning it may appear engulfed in flames only to completely vanish at the strike of noon until somebody accidentally walks into it, bloody nose in hand. Living under the confusing glare of the Mirror Tower the people of Iridia have long since learnt to stop paying attention to strange occurrences, choosing to simply ignore them rather than live in a perpetual state of dismay. This has lead to no small amount of unfortunate events, such as fires being left to ravage the city unopposed, believed to be yet another in a long line of illusions to regularly disrupt the city.
The impossible tower of illusions at the very heart of Iridia is protected by the Mirror Guard, elite soldiers made to appear as giants through the art of Illusionism. Being enchanted to appear twenty feet tall takes some getting used to as Mirror Guards don't see themselves enlarged to gigantic proportions, but do see their fellows as such, creating all sorts of confusion among the unsuspecting soldiers. Once the illusion is broken, the Mirror Guard will once again appear regular in size, their position possibly turned precarious being spread too thinly vs the opposing army.
The Mirror Guard is equipped with enchanted mirror shields. Gleaming and flowing with strange colours, these strange shields will mesmerize and confuse onlookers during battle. Though a strong-willed warrior will stay focused through this trickery, those less mentally disciplined might quickly find themselves in disarray, swinging blindly at both friend and foe."

In fact, it likely doesn't even have a form but rather project an illusion of one directly into its observer's mind, given that several people can look at the Phantasmagorian and argue about the vastly differing appearance of the horrifying being they're staring at. Living between worlds the Phantasmagorians have an unsettling ability to capture unwarded teleporting travelers and even dreamers within the Void and feed on their fears and emotions. The ability of the Masters Macabre to conjure equally horrifying images and delight in the fear they cause in others makes them closely associated with this monster and may explain why they have succeeded in befriending the creature. Though the Phantasmagorian is also a master of the macabre it is itself a rather cowardly creature."

In order to create such eyes, a mixture of soap and mercury is heated in a rune-covered retort until they are both vaporized. The vapors are then carefully blown through a long silver straw until a bubble forms at the tip. It is then left to dry in the reflection of the sun in 13 small concave silver mirrors. As the bubble is heated it will float upwards and out in the world."

Unlike Golden Mirrors which hold amateurish and blurry semblances of things, or Silver Mirrors which hold quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this great vault hold images that are nigh perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they will even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelieving their existence will work, begging the question at which point does a copy of something start being as real as the original. The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Monstrous Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror. Though Monstrous Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds of exotic monsters, only as many as an Illusionist dares control are released when the mirror is activated."

The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Monstrous Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror.

Though these mirrors are few in number with some of them even many hundreds of years old, they represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors which hold amateurish and blurry semblances of things, or Silver Mirrors which hold quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this great vault hold images that are nigh perfect in every regard.

The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Monstrous Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror.

#descr "At the very top of the Mirror Tower there exists a hidden vault where the most precious mirrors patiently await, preserved under a thin veil of dust and cobwebs. Though these mirrors are few in number with some of them even many hundreds of years old, they represent the pinnacle of the art of Illusionism. Unlike Golden Mirrors which hold amateurish and blurry semblances of things, or Silver Mirrors which hold quite realistic but incomplete images, the mirrors in this great vault hold images that are nigh perfect in every regard. The images held are so impeccable they will even bleed when cut, and no amount of disbelieving their existence will work, begging the question at which point does a copy of something start being as real as the original. The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Macabre Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror. Though Macabre Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds or exotic monsters, only as many as an Illusionist dares control are released when the mirror is activated."

The only thing that seems to set the monsters captured in these mirrors apart from their real counterparts is a lack of free will, or perhaps a soul. As a Macabre Mirror can hold trapped within it any number of images many Master Illusionists spend their entire lives slowly adding to their ever growing collection. A Master Illusionist's life work is typically finished once he fumbles a ritual and is killed by the monster whose image he is attempting to trap within the great mirror. Though Macabre Mirrors often hold dozens or even hundreds or exotic monsters, only as many as an Illusionist dares control are released when the mirror is activated."

#descr "A likeness so perfectly captured it is indistinguishable from a real Ether Warrior. Ether Warriors are members of a race of large, humanoid beings that were banished from this world in ancient times. Their wars drained the world of Arcana and they were forced to enter other realms of existence in order to continue their clan wars. The lesser races and their gods sealed the astral gates behind the Ether Warriors to ensure the safety of the world. Ether Warriors are powerful beings and can live for centuries unless slain in battle. All members of the race are ethereal and very difficult to harm with non-magical weapons. Ether Warriors use Moon Blades, magical swords that cause additional damage to magical beings. Ether Warriors are magical beings and cannot be commanded by mere mortals."

A single siege golem counts as one hundred normal soldiers when besieging a castle."

#newspell
#name "Danse Macabre"
#descr "With this spell an Illusionist plays a macabre tune and creates faint and blurry illusions of a dozen or so skeletons at the distant edges of the battlefield. The skeletons will slowly dance towards the enemy in perfect harmony with one another, their images growing increasingly more real with each passing step of their macabre dance. Once the illusions take a near perfect likeness of a skeleton they will continue to dance but a new faint illusion will also appear next to them. The dancing skeletons will continue to dance and create new illusions until their macabre dance is over, potentially creating many new illusions until their macabre tune is finished and their dance ended."
#details "Illusory skeletons are summoned at the edges of the battlefield. Every few battle turns the last created illusion will spawn another one. This cycle will carry on several times, increasing the potential number of the summons five-fold at maximum."

#newspell
#name "Perpetual Illusion"
#descr "With this masterful deception an Illusionist creates a perpetual illusion. Several both incredibly complex yet laughably poor illusory soldiers will appear at the edges of the battle, charging towards the enemy ranks. Before long these illusions will simply stop, turning impotent, and spawn a new set of broken illusions that will continue the charge in their stead for a short distance before also failing. Such a poorly created illusion would get any Illusionist thrown out of Iridia if not for the fact that the original illusions continue to spawn new, broken illusions for the remainder of the battle. Though the illusions quickly fall inert and stop posing any kind of threat, unless the perpetual illusion is dispelled with haste it will quickly overflow the battlefield with still illusions, creating a confusing mess for the enemy on the battlefield. Most enemies simply choose to ignore the presence of these illusions at first, as is the norm when dealing with Iridia trickery, not realizing the danger before they find themselves surrounded by an ever increasing horde of illusions. Though breaking the cycle and dispelling the original illusions is a simple enough matter, it is a task which grows increasingly more difficult with every passing minute of the battle."

#descr "The Mirror Lord is an Illusionist of such great power that he has mastered his own mortality through the art known as light-splitting. By performing an impossible feat of magic, through the use of the Mirror Tower's great prismatic mirrors, the Mirror Lord has managed to refract his being into three distinct parts; his living shadow, the uninhibited impulses and his darker nature, his manifest image, the mindless subconscious instincts of his being, and his 'self', the ego, the intangible intellect of the being that is the Mirror Lord. Now, donning a godly mantle, the Mirror Lord has taken the role of a Pretender God. He is a master of magic and can be adept in several of the magic paths. 

The Mirror Lord Phantasm will gain the primary magic path, Air, in equal amount to the Mirror Lord, or up to a maximum of A4.
The Mirror Lord Shadow will gain the Mirror Lord's skill in Death magic up to a maximum of D4."

#selectnation 150
#name "Iridia" -- Iridia or Tirindur
#epithet "The Mendacious City"
#era 2
#descr "Hidden behind a veil of trickery and illusions lies the city of Iridia, the home of the Illusionists, cunning and conniving mages that practice the subtle art of Illusionism. At the very heart of the great city stands the Mirror Tower, the center of the Illusionists' power, impossibly tall and constantly shifting and changing according to the whims of its peculiar occupants. It is here where great feats of Illusionism are performed and promising tricksters trained. The people of Iridia have long since learnt to live alongside the Illusionists and with all that entails. Illusions have become a part of everyday life in Iridia and most people go about their business politely ignoring whatever may be happening in their surroundings, be that a parade of dancing skeletons, or twenty-foot-tall giants clad in mirrors patrolling the streets. As Iridia is too small to have an organized standing army, and its rulers too disinterested in worldly matters and the administration of the same, the people primarily have to rely on mercenaries to defend the walls of their fine city. Many a mercenary company finds its way to the small and elusive Iridia, lured by offers of substantial pay from the Mirror Tower's seemingly inexhaustible treasure vaults. Iridian forces are perhaps small but are aided by powerful illusions. Many an invading warlord has laughed derisively at a small opposing force whose vain commander brings large, fragile mirrors to the field of battle. Most of those warlords have then had to watch in frustration and disbelief as their own ordered ranks turn into a chaotic, snarled mess, their soldiers distracted and confused by bright lights, frightened by visions only they can see, and cut down and trampled into the ground by soldiers and fantastical monsters that marched forth from the enchanted mirrors. Those facing Illusionists are advised to underestimate them at their own peril."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Mercenaries and various types of illusions and phantasms. All national soldiers of Iridia are protected by glamour in friendly dominion.
Magic: Powerful Air, Astral, Death, some Nature and Earth.
Priests: Weak. Dominion conflict bonus -1."
#brief "Iridia is a small city hidden behind a veil of illusions and deceptions. It is ruled by the masters of deceit and lies, the Illusionists of the Mirror Tower. The Illusionists of Iridia are capable of weaving complex illusions that hide or alter form, and are best known for trapping magic and images within mirrors and releasing them during battle. Iridia is defended by mercenary companies drawn to the city by the illusion of wealth."

	#descr "The Unquenchable Flame is the progeny of the All-Consuming Flame. It is a three-headed dragon sprung from the Abysian holy flame and is in essence its avatar. Through the power of the All-Consuming Flame the dragon is even capable of burning away one's essence completely and consuming the soul in spectral fire.The great burning dragon is a primordial elemental force of incredible destructive powers, and if left unchecked will surely set the world aflame.
The Unquenched Flame has a chance to raise those burned away with the Unquenched Breath as Flaming Spirits."

#selectnation 157
#name "Abysia Reborn"
#epithet "Children of Flame"
#era 1
#brief "Abysians are lava-born humanoids that radiate heat. Abysians mainly use heavy infantry. They have skilled Fire and Blood mages and their priests can perform blood sacrifices. Abysians dislike cold provinces."
#descr "Abysia is a hot wasteland, at the center of which lies a great volcano whose lava-lit caverns are inhabited by magma-born humanoids. Their flesh radiates heat and they are not harmed by flames. Abysians are stronger than humans and use very heavy armor and weaponry. Bows are not used, because they would burn to cinders in the glowing hands of the Abysians. The war machine of Abysia also includes Salamanders, lizardlike beings composed of the same hot lava-born flesh as the Abysians. The Anointed of Rhuax and the Anathemant Priests of the Flame Cult practice blood sacrifice to strengthen the power of the Awakening God. The Warlocks of the Smouldercone, a newly formed magical order, practice Blood magic and search for suitable blood slaves in conquered lands. Abysians prefer to live in extremely hot places. They do not farm or hunt for a living, so their income and supplies are not affected by the Growth or Death scale of a province. However, population will still die slowly in Abysia-controlled provinces with Death scales."
#summary "Race: Radiates heat, fire resistance, prefers Heat scale +3, wasteland survival. Death and Growth scales have half the standard effect on income and population growth, and no effect on supplies.
Military: Very heavy infantry, no missile weapons, salamanders
Magic: Fire, Blood, Astral, some Earth
Priests: Powerful, can perform blood sacrifices
Dominion: Spreads Heat (max 3)"
