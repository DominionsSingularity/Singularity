-- POSTPONED: Marmec re-spriting completely. They aren't fishy enough! Fins, etc. Will likely use the assets elsewhere afterwards.

-- Look at synergies of strong nations, and if it's possible to break them without lore issues.
-- Find every nation that qualifies for Eriu-tier and higher, and ruthlessly squash its potential so everyone whines. #Probablynotserious

-- The skalds are spellsingers with all this entails - LA communions in particular suffer.
-- rejected: sprite unchanged
-- --		LA
-- Reverted LA Dragenheim cost penalty (not having Ochreil armor is big deal) 
-- Renamed Shamans into Skalds. LA gained Skald Wanderers, but Elders aren't skalds

-- --		EA
-- Added H2F1 solar flare spell for FAS paths. Does 11+ AOE 1 prec 100 fire damage + solar rays
-- --	--	Ssaon'raha
-- An idle note based on DF playthrough: the leading case for Ssaia child mortality is parental abuse.
-- Emergent gameplay it may be I'm content; the tiny little buggers tantrum out and get heads caved in for the trouble.
-- This happens at tender age of 4 when they're old enough to get drunk, but not big enough to shrug it off.
-- As they say: "seems legit". The bigger Mn'neha in social environment are reasonably safe, and well-armed to boot.

-- Two guesses where they'd stolen the recipe and first doesn't actually count.

-- Like, ssaia didn't exist in the first place after the fact.
-- Just to underscore: introduction of Brutal Brew into mass Brutannic consumption 
-- has occured *before* its recipe was first developed, timeline-wise, but not chronologically. If that makes sense? Time travel is weird.

-- done: correct armor of malice and remove poisonarmor - it's extraneous.
-- Reduced Brutannic Knights MR to fit with non-mageknights; magic steed or not they are too strong.
-- +5g slave witches price, now 120g for 16 rp.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- POSTPONED: Rewrite mess of Hobgoblin army, add hero to summon them?
-- Reduced Psycho Fire damage 10 -> 9, shadows -1 hp/str
-- Psycho Goblins price increase 23->26, still dirt cheap for crossbow-plus.
-- Sacred werepyrgs 45->55g.
-- All Pyrgs enc 2->3, that includes cavalry.
-- Siege bonus reduced 5->3, they're dumb and demolish other places instead of wall
-- --		MA/LA
-- Dark Elders are slowrec. No more OP capital recruitment!
-- Pyrghosts gained ghost defense bonus as proper. Still meh.
-- Sacred infantry -> 35g in MA, 30g in LA.
-- --		EA
-- Fixed fortera error, added Raid Cheiftains 
-- (design has changed enough to warrant it; balance implications aside)
-- Their Beastmaster reduced to 1
-- --	--	Electrum
-- POSTPONED: add stormimmune wights. Not really necessary atm, no D mages.
-- POSTPONED: powerlevel tuning; it's evidently strong.
-- Can't really do anything short of reducing TS damage, thou.
-- All Rune of XX spells range reduced to 5, added Flaming Arrow/Aim/Courage effects
-- Reduced natural protection of all giants, from 1/3/5 to 1/2/3. Now sacreds less tough.
-- --	--	Dassem
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- POSTPONED: add correct caveman wight sprite
-- POSTPONED: decide on minotaur wight issue.
-- Added Spellscorch Banner, which screws with all the spellcasters via cloud effects. Multiple banners stack.
-- done: add sprite for Spellscorch Banner (awesome counterspell item; turn 2+ spells will fizzle)
-- Since primary weakness of Ruthum is low-MR, it might well help disrupt big spells like Master Enslave from small spellcasters.
-- Doesn't actually work fast enough to kick in turn 1, and will certainly get the carrier unconscious.
-- Increased Everburning Flicker 9-> 10rp, so there's a reason to use it over quills+imps beyond just air shortage.
-- Asehn Battleaxe f1 -> f2, plus EA discount.
-- Reduced Flesh Immolation damage to 1 fire; fireres will reduce damage to nothin.
-- Corrected Burn The Bull effect so your promotion spells don't kill the caster, always. Also corrected shapechanges.
-- --	--	Impros
-- POSTPONED: add more heroes for Impros!
-- --	--	Tetracheires
-- done: sprite for garment of gaia
-- National H2 buffs scale with priest level, now.
-- REDUCED PRICES: 5g discount on *most* tetracheieres troops, 
-- They're too glass cannon and barely stronger than default humans.
-- Lowered Call Mikrocheires to Conj 6; the cost is intimidating regardless even if they are better than Yazata and Daevas.
-- --		MA
-- Increased castledef on Defenders to 3. Their cost unchanged; garrison troops and elite lineholders, they are terribly vulnerable to magic.
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- Applied lots of item forging discounts for you guessed, dragonscale items. EA for most items, LA only scale mail.
-- Construct bone drakes increased cost and no longer D1; get a necro.
-- Added Breeding spells for EA and MA, spawn lotsa troops and serpentkin for slaves instead of gold. 
-- Most importantly, doesn't require resources or recpoints. AND - MA Drakonia are sacreds, will all that implies.
-- done: add sprites for wights (2 small 3 large). Smallest mages get C'tissian wights 3181. Could still use work, honestly - those are just unarmored recolors.
-- POSTPONED: add events depicting EA enminities properly
-- Added dragonkin breeding, 50-slave B2X3 spell, serpentkin+truebred mix
-- Only EA/MA can use it, and MA Drakonia has issues getting it done natively.
-- All non-dragons lost 1 prec.
-- Some heroes size 4->5 as proper. They also get generic twiceborn shapes.
-- Awaken-blood Dragons get undead dragon twiceborn shapes, that includes their small mage shapes.
-- Adjusted all infantry; twohander slaves 9g, other lineups now priced at spearshield/+1g twohander/+2g dualwield.
-- --		EA
-- Now build giant forts for giant dragons. Honestly a nerf of 150g tax for dragon production.
-- Also fixed wrong wall defenders - they weren't slingers.
-- --		MA
-- Hero F2N3B3 -> F3N2B3. So red crossbreeding instead of green one by default.
-- --	--	Dragenheim
-- --	--	Nod
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- POSTPONED: Maze of Frozen Flames 366 connection to EA specifically and nation in general.

-- Slightly buffed sneakershroud MR bonus.
-- Nofinds aplenty. Shadow Shrouds discount forging.
-- Lower resists for Desert Ku.
-- --	--	Chasos
-- POSTPONED: add more items for EA.
-- --		EA
-- Some small tweaks: idols more unrest quelling, wildkin all bers 2 non-sac.
-- --		MA
-- Spellforges aren't masons but reduce unrest. At their cost that's reasonable synergy with blood.
-- --	--	Ochreil
-- Kanmetall Swords inflict Kanmetall Wounds, demonkilling AOE def-negates effect with Bleeding on damage. Less OP on singletarget, more OP versus fat unarmored chaff.
-- small sword now 12 gems, big sword now 15 gems.
-- Sand to Sand aoe 3++ -> 4++, greater shatter 3+ ->4+
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Corrected Stygian Elders magic resist score of 4 (??)
-- --	--	Zel
-- Corrected Zazziks, he was commented out.
-- --		MA
-- Spells were still in Const instead of Ench, fixed.
-- Sand Wraiths are now Death/Earth summons outside combat. So the bad Ceremonies pave way for mass wraiths
-- Wastelands allow cheap labs too.
-- Sand Generals are now by default E2 and not E1.
-- --	--	Ssaon'raha
-- ADDED MA VERSION.
-- Kick attack of large ssaia has weak poison now.
-- All Ssaia have single hand. Self-mutilators lose misc slot for hand; there's an item with same effect now.
-- High-prot cloaks only attached to a crown (cloak of prot/crown of champion)
-- Spells corrected, added transform to cap-only mages.
-- Honestly, too many changes to list.
-- Nerfbat: large critters base cost up to 45g, 
-- sacreds 65->70 since they are severely capped by res/recproints.
-- done: redo the heavy cloak sprites, legs forward cloak background; 
-- huge ones already qualified - only 4 large sprites altered
-- done: MA nation of human servants and holy ssaia, FAD with fawedn magic. 
-- done: finish human sprites, ssaia sprites.
-- POSTPONED: add national-specific shields using their enc 0 shield entry. 
-- POSTPONED Maybe replace token of terror with shield of terror?
-- --		MA
-- ALL DONE.
-- rejected: add MA twiceborn wights sizes 2-3 (there aren't size 2 D mages or size 3 units, period).
-- Added very meh human multiheroes, who aren't even sacred. Dilute strong ssaia heroes, but are stealthy natively. Also armorslot.
-- Added transform to get size 6 ea-style SC. Nowhere near the EA proliferation and 20gems worth. Added similar spell to EA too.

-- No, that's not a post-factum rationalisation: Brutal Brew is a product first featured by Cult of Burned Hand (granted, it hadn't had that name back then, and was an Order of Burning Light. Alterac still uses these abilities interchangeably). 
-- Back before Brutannia or my Dominions modding were a thing at all.
-- Two guesses where they'd stolen the recipe and first doesn't actually count.
-- Before anyone goes wild mass guessing: these Cults are all stemming from the same origin.
-- Related tidbit: Ssaon'raha doesn't actually exist in LA modpack lore, period. 
-- Like, ssaia didn't exist in the first place after the fact.
-- Just to underscore: introduction of Brutal Brew into mass Brutannic consumption 
-- has occured *before* its recipe was first developed, timeline-wise, but not chronologically. If that makes sense? Time travel is weird.

I'll take time for a short review on what has been done since Dom 5 went out:
1) Swarmhive, Sukarakoyash, Pyrgdor, Dassem, Ochreil, Robbledoth and EA/LA Brutannia are mostly fleshed out. Unsurprising, since most of them are oldest designs anyway and Ochreil owes its recent lore to me digging for HFS in a wholly separate fortress.
2) Zel, Krylud, Chasos, Impros, Icedgarth, Drakonia, Ruthum, MA Brutannia, all Tetracheires, feel like something needs added, but aren't too badly off.
3) Abolethive is badly in need of LA redesign,
4) Dragenheim suffers from some lack of (thematic) diversity; though it *is* partly intentional, a non-mage commander would've been nice.
5) Arcania/Cannum are... EA is okay, but MA and LA are really bland. Could use some Hegude-style therapy, and keep early AESD paths throught the ages instead of introducing unrelated FW paths. Possibly re-develop B magic like Ether Lords proper, but I don't like this idea at all (everyone has blood magic already, damn it!). Or actually justifying FW paths somehow.

Non-released designs: 
- MA Azeroth, Eastern Kingdoms has some nice details (like dwarven mortars and everything non-basic requiring terrainrec+monpresentrec), and is slated to be released before LA Alterac.
- LA Alterac, Burned Hand is more or less LA Brutannia taken for a different spin (the same way as MA Chasos is totally not LA Brutannia). Oddly enough, *still* manages more units than MA Azeroth does, and extensively uses nationally specific Fire/Anti-sacred spell lineup.
- EA Heroica, Evil Is Not Good; an old, almost ancient design, which was completed for Dom 4 and was second to be ported to Dom5. Despite age still lacks sprites. Has ever-popular promotion mechanic ensuring headaches, wizards with awesome research powers, utter lack of sacred troops, and cave-teleports, but overall coherency is somewhere at Hegude tier.
- EA Eldf and MA Eldf; names provisional, nations "dedicated to the ruthless protection of nature". Three guesses as to source material. Feature really really badly equipped foot troops, and awesome variety of animal cavalry and War Elephants. Of course, utter lack of iron is mandatory deterrent to their troops being actually viable.
- Diablo-universe conversions; weren't completed back in DOm4, still aren't. Unlikely to happen, but you never know.
Old Dom4 designs which didn't survive conversion:
- Malevil/Vilium were cruelly murdered in favor of Chasos. The LA Malevil theme of returning old spirits still remains undeveloped.
- Hegude was pretty much trash, because it was absolutely incoherent lore-wise. Don't remind me of this horrid thing.
- Crudely stapled MA Zel was absorbed into MA Chasos and MA Brutannia. Enough said.

-- Added Fear to size 4+ Wights, and slightly more cold. Ochreiske are Tartarian tier, now.

-- All wights are corpseeaters and slowly, inexorably grow larger. 2hp/month, *normally*
-- meaning very long timeframes (a normal 70 turn game will see size 3->size 4 transform, but likely not -> size 6; and LA only has size 2 necromancers anyway)
-- Giving Coral Blades speeds up the process somewhat; Gift of Health pretty much jumpstarts them.
-- (in Dom 10, a small D1 necromancer growing into size 6 SC chassis in <12 turns? Yes please; a Karazhil? Yes twice please, +1D ones are most scary if not holy.)
-- Even in Dom 8-9, it's freakishly fast
-- Unless GoH is dispelled fast, you're basically spamming Tartarians.
-- ...Scary. Abusable but balanced, since N7 is reeeally faraway bless. And being wary of GoH is just common sense.
-- Okay, with some adjustment they're more difficult to grow now. Still scary.
-- Their naked chassis isn't terribly impressive (a MR 20 undead meatsack which dies to Scourges if not instantly), so gems spent on gearing them do count.

-- Uh, oops, forgot about Soul Vortex. Can and will transform mid-combat and keep Soulvortexing until size 6?!
-- Mildly concerning, but this requires Soul Vortex and fighting lots of living enemies. Survival is an issue.

-- +Sprite for shadow cloth armors
-- +Sprite for shadow trident
-- +Sprite for karazhil totem (air tmp gems, for Wind Guide/Arrow Fend by wights)

-- v1.02; "Why I Have Politely Listened To All Your Suggestions And Rejected Damn Near Every One"

[quote=Isiloon;1733216261945405910]I would do these changes to the ants
[/quote]

Okay, first; thank you for your input, because it did result in some productive changes... after writing up a 1k long rant covering why not. Only one of your suggested changes went through at this time, and even then by virtue of already having been implemented :(

[quote]
- no sacred on the godborns until they reach their final stage 
(having 100's of sacreds can be abused easily)
[/quote]

If we were to follow this logic, Mictlan and Lanka should've never existed in the first place ;). Honestly, in MA human sacreds of Swarmhive are levites minus and melt to any other non-sacred elite infantry, while cap-only sacreds are in limited supply. Regen-Bloodbond-Fortitude doesn't actually help, since these sacreds are so goddamn naked (unlike the elite LA infantry). Mindblasters in particular are far less scary in combat than their quantity implies; unlike Illithids and Olms, they can't kill things at all.
There is currently only a single shapechange for each sacreds, and beyond special abilities (amphibian, firepower, flight+shock weapon) they're just a little better than regular myrmecs; that is, monkey-tier.

Homo Godborn are an okay, but expensive heavy infantry with mental shock. Paralyze aside, most sacreds beat them pound-for-pound. The amount of other Godborn sacreds is currently actually capped at about 3-4x for normal nation =domstr+15, well that and 20 Lesser Godborn if you're really greedy but they cost much more gold that they're worth unless E6B6 and Strength of Giants are applied - they aren't flagellants. Other sacreds require a prophet to summon and also cost additional gems.

For comparison: a single FB Mictlan priest can produce at least 3 Ozzies per turn, assuming 1/3 rate of recruitment as early as turn 15 you're looking at 15 Ozzies per turn costing 65 slaves (not a difficult goal) and they're better than 15 Terra Godborn. Not that I'm implying Mictlan is balanced.

[quote]
- more strength on the small ants to compensate for no sacred
(an ant the size of a dog would still be ridiculously strong)
[/quote]
There's physics, and then there's metaphysics; dog-sized ants being stronger is the latter. That aside, there's already AN attack and national quickness buff that produce the desired effect - namely, the effect of zerg rush. A big enough stack of buffed ants end up killing stuff pretty well. At worst for non-sacreds, using Myrmec Soldiers to ignore repel is advised (they have best high-damage attack density).

[quote]
- no access to air magic, you could drop water as well probably, or maybe give the queen a tiny chance to get either
(they dont really need this with earth/nature/astral/water already) 
[/quote]

Short of me deciding to make a complete nation redesign, overall path diversity won't change... much WESN magic are integral parts of national lore for one reason or another. Fire was added because of acid evocations. Widespread air access was added to dilute randoms... I can get behind removing it for Myrmec Evokers and Princes (it helps get more acid for one) but all other mages will retain it. And with communions, having A1 means nothing. Really, who thought it a good idea to invent communions, Thunderstrike, Arrow Fend and Fog Warriors,.. oh right that's Illwinter. Can't do anything about it.
Reducing Evokers path level to E1S1 will more or less obsolete single-path Controllers, with no reason to ever recruit those awkward half-communion slaves when 20-30 more gold delivers a better one.
Earth and Nature protection buffs are actually less than valuable on naturally prot 10-15 troops with no armor (Legions of Steel +0, Iron/Marble/Gold/Lead +5-10, Barkskin +0), even more so with Hard Skin bless.

[quote]
- I would make the units mindless, so without a leader they start dying/falling apart, but also don't route from combat as easily etc
(Hivemind)
[/quote]

On hivemind: it's all represented by slave tag and taskmaster. Low base morale, huge taskmaster bonus, it works out at normal human levels plus items. Mindless won't work nicely because I like national quickness buff and we don't have many tag options to work off: I so don't want buffed elementals or monkeys or wolves I'd rather have coward hivemind ants. Also, dissolving mindless is another reason why I didn't implement it. And finally, mindless is a huge Astral Corruption advantage; having easy Gift of Reason for sacreds who *do* have natural magic path is an exploit I don't want. Though sacreds not being mindless... Eh.

[quote]
- would make mindblasts weaker and not paralyze
(consider Rlyeh has "ancient hyper intelligent squids" that cost a fortune and mindblast is basically their key feature - ants get that for 1/3 the price and much more of it)
[/quote]

For one, this request is already the case. Swarmhive doesn't have that much mindblast (okay, commanders can have some less Mindblast, but still), it costs way more than 1/3, and it's nerfed to uselessness. Low quality aside it's also only 5 ammo whereas Illithids get to fire all 10 shots. It's important enough since battles often draws past 5 turns.

When I stripped uncapped damage from Mindblast, and reduced paralyze duration, those two factors turned out to significantly contribute towards damage for focused mindblast. On average, several stacks of Illithids vs 2x as many Soldiers end up with Illithids winning, and Illithids don't suffer any casualties from ranged combat unless ration is insane 10:1. Homo Godborn cost more and, while

Replacing effect with dt_realstun actually made it stronger because it always works. Removing stun and paralyze altogether goes against the intended design - unlike Mind Blast, paralyze *is* the primary effect for Mental shock, not damage. Mind Blast actually kills low-MR troops, fast, and otherwise paralyzes for 1-8 turns (yes, in a single hit); Mental Shock only does it with singular targets with several hits per target. I suppose I could replace effect with fatigue, but that's more of a D effect, or at best one associated with Stellar cascades which most definitely isn't fitting.

Overall, subpar performance of mental shock blasters compared to solid Illithids is a solid fact. They literally don't kill anyone, and only in melee start scoring kills if they even can.

[quote]
- remove hand, armor and helmet slots from ant commanders
(nature + astral + earth + water = quickening, body ethereal, temper flesh, ironskin and personal regeneration.... basically the best self buffs in the game, they are just missing soul vortex ;) - do they need access to vine shields and frost brands ontop of that, and for such a cheap price?)
[/quote]

To spare long rant on widespread obsession with weaksauce brands and fragile vine shields (neither are in any way vital for Swarmhive thugs in particular): yes, this change removes their ability to be thugs. No, I don't see how it'll help national balance at all, never mind the absurd logic, major booster deprivation, and some troops redesign implementing it requires. I didn't create several national items only to remove slots they fit into. There's a reason nobody ever recruits mass Aboleths for EA R'lyeh, despite being the most massable S3 mages in the entire game. Even Abodai are only worth their Wight shape.

I don't see how being able to thug something nation can recruit is in any way unbalancing. Heck, even MA Ulm can spam E2F1 thugs, if you're sick enough to waste gold and gems that way.
- The WESN spread you mention only happens for a few Queens, and even then I'd rather use them for other duties rather than thugging. If you can afford this, you're closing to lategame where everything is possible.
- WES Evokers are old, lack N, and rack up a lot of fatigue/afflictions pretty quickly.
- Sitting pretty and being useless aside, Princesses have very, very low stats for thugging (a barely elite human) and only 5% of E magic. Even if two princesses can stack in a single tile and get off AOE buffs... they still tend to get hit and die horribly without armor. National Quickness buff they can use costs 60 fatigue, which knocks them out and requires fatigue management (which, with neither E nor boot slot, is an issue).

-- No heavy torchdaggers or light twohandbanes, reduced invulnerability 15->10, hauberks nostealthy, only daggers assassinate, others goodleaders.
-- The ReGenesis spell summoning them scales slightly worse, an N10 caster only nets 22 sacreds total (but they are armored now).

-- #skip weapons... don't actually skip if they are melee; only interact with #range050 and similar.
-- So the Hungry Ones were inadvertedly buffed a bit.

-- Moved event codes from -399 to -1999.
--		TODO
-- Events for EA Zel (similar to Dom4 version, but with some twist).
-- AI hints for all nations. Not completed.
-- Cleanup Nod and add sacred heavy mutants. Not completed.
-- EA Electrum redesign: more CLoud Giants, fewer civilized Storm Giants (basically just Bronzeclads). Remove Storm Priestesses?
-- Expand on Dragenheim troops, too few; add wolves and polar seals if all else fails.
-- Tie LA Drakonia to Chasos disaster.
-- DO SOMETHING ABOUT DRAGENHEIM! Bugged lingering or not, they have the worst troop diversity, little lore ties,
-- can't really complain about their magic though. But still, too bland and LA are basically reskinned Atlantis on land.
-- Add national pretender rainbows when appropriate.
-- --	--	Arcania/Cannum
-- Phantasmal Emblem const 6 -> const 4.
-- --		LA
-- Fewer Arcanian Ghosts summoned per mass summon spell, and early conj 4 is more expensive. THey also get S2D2 from giftreason.
-- Returned aren't combat casters anymore.
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Removed research penalties from Controllers and Brigadeers.
-- Finished unit overhaul; workers/warworkers/warriors and Soldiers/troopers have new prices of 6/11/22 and 28.
-- Size 4+ myrmec bite is chargebonus, like LA knights
-- Replaced EA and MA Aboleth border color with deep blue one, distinct from EA C'tissian.
-- --		EA/MA
-- Allowed Lesser Godborn recruitment, plus non-sacred lesser Young Godborn (cost 7g and no holy limits, but also pay scary upkeep and 15 recpoints)
-- All sacred-summoning spells are cheaper, but summon fewer troops.
-- Slightly tweaked event freespawn (it's weaker than summons, 2-12 per turn compared to fixed 12+ batches, but doesn't cost any gems)
-- --		MA/LA
-- Princesses and Swarm Wizards more coward.
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --		EA
-- Reduced income penalty to 5%
-- Brutal Strike is twohanded for 25% damage bonus.
-- Hounds summoned 4 for 40 slaves.
-- Spirits of War -2 Str, -2 MR and less resistant to fire/shock/cold naturally.
-- Small Spirits of War get worse equipment (no fire flare size 2, only fire burst for size 4 ones)
-- Price of Recall/Become spirit of War raised to 122 slaves (immortality on good chassis)
-- Every troop is a skirmisher so morale is even better.
-- Worse Hun stats in line with others, higher Veteran price. Also skirmishers.
-- Disciples of Brutus are 2 compoints, cost still 235g.
-- Increased requirements for Demon Knights drastically to B4E2, plus price 81->99.
-- Demonknights reduced MR 17->16, ambi 3->2, popkill and unrest 3->5 per turn.
-- Greatly increased Brutal Consecration cost (222) and popkill to make up for piddly F1B1 requirements, fewer troops arrive.
-- --		LA
-- Increased prices of cap-only troops (they're really good because Doomblade etc are good, and Guardians are Wardens plus)
-- Doomsworn Pyromancers gained supernatural fire resistance of 8.
-- Split Flames of Doom and Chapel of Doomsworn (that nice mechanic when I summon sites and get moar bless in exchange for scales)
-- Added site-converting spells which add Death/Turmoil/Misf-magic, and bless bonus.
-- Other players can conquer Brutannia and claim these sites as well, if they already have trash scales and don't mind more minor stacked blesses.
-- (though these spells aren't easy to cast, even with boosters).
-- Heralds of Doom are more expensive and -5 to non-poison resists (rainbow is attractive anyway).
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Weakened Werepyrgs invulnerability to 15 points (now they're reasonably killable)
-- --	--	Electrum
-- --		LA
-- Removed Earth magic from Ironmasters (they aren't agarthans and really have no buisness being better E mages)
-- --	--	Dassem
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Touch of Hunger is considered twohanded weapon.

-- Added

-- Corrected fort for EA (started with Palisades instead of woodfort)

-- --		MA
-- Weakened Frostguard bolts 13->12
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- Corrected item slots for all Irekle (no body armor, 3 misc)
-- Irekle +1 more base enc (6) so they are more burst-like blenders
-- Akdavyls and Karadavyls worse stats (+1 enc -1 dmg -1 att/def, -1 *power for servants, less HP/ -1 weapon damage),
--  but Akdavyl Viziers conj 7 -> conj 6 (to match Karadavyl Court
-- and Karaertkyches slightly better too.
-- --	--	Chasos

-- Add national pretender rainbows when appropriate.
-- --	--	Arcania/Cannum
-- Reduced base stats for ALL size 2 arcanians, price unchanged: -1 (tougher 2-3) hp, -1 str, -1 att, -1 def. But lance is improved.
-- Still badass 14/14/14/14 in native dominion and better than Nemedians if not stealthy.
-- Blacksteel Champions and Star Guards also weakened, the latter even more RP intensive.
-- Returned 1 forgebonus for Gothmorg.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Cannum Squires use light lances and not heavy ones (a little lower damage)
-- --		LA
-- Magician Knights weakened, while price is increased.
-- Magician Champions are expert leaders.
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- Reworked Felblade which is now a bad national pen booster (anyone seen FW crosspath caster?).
-- Reduced Sundering of Draenor price to 140 slaves.
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Wight Myrmecs added for all national troops, sizes 4 and 6. 
-- Naturally there are no D mages, but empowering/getting pretender nets a nice size 4 lifeless unit.
-- Note: Myrmecs are glass cannons, since their def score is low and protection is mediocre compared to stuff after Legions/Barkskin.
-- in MA and later they're really easily melting to crossbows if a meatwall with high enough prot/regen is available.
-- Fixed Prowess of the Hive to be properly AOE1 for secondary effect.
-- Reduced Warriors recruitment cost 45 -> 35 points.
-- Disabled Protomarmecs and associated item. May or may not restore later when sprite rework goes through.
-- No dominion requirement for recruitment.
-- --		EA
-- Capital allows full UW lineup recruitment, so you can expand UW right off the bat.
-- --		EA/MA
-- Replaced starting controllers with Evokers (guaranteed S1H3 combo and not 50% chance)
-- Increased Soldier and Trooper gold costs once again to 25 to match Warriors, reduced MR score to 12.
-- Overhauled the sacred mechanic; they now spawn through event codes when pretender with high FAWES is present; NO RECRUITMENT.
-- Only prophetess can summon them, but it's Conj 0 spells now (and given how bad unpropheted expansion might be, that's a problem)
-- --		MA/LA
-- Improved Ether Myrmecs by +3 prot (equal to Ether Warriors, still worse naturally)
-- --		LA
-- Godsworn Knights more expensive, and more recpoints costs.
-- Evokers paths F1W2E1S1, but only 10% random, 165g cost (E1 = ironskin = a lot tougher)
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --		EA
-- All national spells up one level (no more Blood 1 sacred spam), disabled Send Brutal Dozen.
-- Send Warhost is Blood 9.
-- Reduced Chaosrec values across the board.
-- Brutal Strike only has 50% chance to be used and is #skip for next attack, reducing overall density.
-- Reduced fire resistance to 3 points for everyone elite enough to have any.
-- Downgraded Brutal Ones attack/defense to match Young Ones, and increased pricing to 20g.
-- Berserkers price greatly increased to 20/35/40
-- Reduced magic resistance, morale, attack/defense, and increased encumberance for Disciples lineup.
-- Downgraded Fire Flare for non-prophets to Flame Burst (Prophets still are glass dervishes)
-- (Yes, they don't have unstoppable early game anymore. No, Demon Knights of Brutus are still scary early at Blood 6).
-- --		LA
-- Added Glyph of the Omen pretender
-- Reduced Brutannic/Doomsworn Berserkers attack and defence to 11/9, price still 20/21g base (with blessbers sacreds are scary).
-- Berserk reduced to +2, so they aren't as good as EA version; still okay with double dmg 20 att 13 attacks (einheres have 23/16)
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Reduced Psychofire Heart primary cost 10f/5b to 5f/5b (very cheap but national)
-- Darksweepers scale worse (8+ instead of 10++), Send is more expensive (30 instead of 25)
-- Darkpower of darksweepers reduced 4->3.
-- --		EA
-- Reduced Pack of Pyrgs mage turn efficiency (5 for 23 like Se'irim and B2F2 requirements so only half Pyrg Masters can cast)
-- --		MA/LA
-- Reduced Pyrghost Pack efficiency (8+ for 15 gems)
-- --	--	Electrum
-- Storm Commanders are now good commanders.
-- --		EA
-- Thuder Elders are good leaders, but still 320g and slow to recruit (discount -12 base for being too old)
-- --	--	Dassem
-- Patience reduction, EA epithet changed to 'Demonologists'.
-- Now can correctly cast Woe spell lineup (and not Dauchora)
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Fixed national Unholy Power spells to no longer affect demons even if it was awesome
-- Touch of Hunger is #skip, #melee50, hard MR, dmg +2 and AP and hits any targets (inanimate is accounted for by lifedrain anyway)
-- --		MA
-- Lowered Hungry Ones gold price to 30g to account for weakened offense (they are nowhere near Wo5E anyway)
-- Removed Douse bonus so Blood Reapers are useful
-- --		LA
-- Might do something about Hungry Vampires, like adding Venomous Claw attack?
-- Base cost for Hungry Ones 17 gold now, base rpcost still 25 (combined with age nets 11 rp troops)
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Added a F1B1 const 0 research booster +9. Removes eye and is tainted, but good for pitiful Drain 3 research levels.
-- --		EA/MA
-- Added Anointment rituals in Blood to cover H3 needs, converting Masters -> Grand -> Anointed and Ashen -> Anointed.
-- All of those Immolators twiceborn as Ashen versions. Empowered normal Immolators do, too.
-- The rituals do fire damage, so stock up on rings before casting.
-- Conveniently sidesteps the Deviltaur nonsense.
-- Improved precision for most Immolators, reduced enc for elite minotaurs to 2
-- -- 	--	EA
-- Lowered Celestial Bulls cost to 80 gold.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Lowered Branded Axesworn cost to 50g.
-- Corrected cap-only smiths mapmove.
-- --	--	Impros
-- --		MA
-- Switched Air and Astral for High Magi, so they now share Augur Elders low astral. A3 are now available which is awesome.
-- Angel Princes now always have S1 and are better disease healers now (for 510g humans they damn better be!).
-- Nation is no longer coastal (can start away from coastline, don't have coastal recruits anyway and Caelums are inland.)
-- --	--	Tetracheires
-- Replaced Mikrocheires pretender flail with morningstar
-- Gained Tetracheires Wight and Mikrocheires Wight shapes. Affects LA most strongly with their massive amounts of holy necromancers, and D Mikrocheires too.
-- Introduced four H2 elemental path spells to reward going for elemental pretender builds: 
-- Unholy Power (Fire), Air Shield + Precision (Air), Elemental Resistance (Water) and Blunt/Poison resistance (Earth or Nature)
-- --	MA
-- Increased Monk recruitment point cost and lowered Monks magic resistance.
-- --	MA/LA
-- Fixed all demon summoning spells so they don't show up for Lanka and are correctly described.
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- Make all dragon scale armors discounted for nations?
-- Lowered Serfs mapmove to 12 (no road rushes to enemy territory)

-- --		MA
-- Increased Truebred Guards cost to 50g
-- --	--	Nod
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- --		LA
-- Slowed down the Warriors of the Seventh Tomb, Adepts are D2W1 + FAE (no more W2D2).
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- Irekle Helmet offers 1 less point of resistance.
-- Added Glyph of the Omen pretender. Lots of pretender options disabled for EA/LA, undead in particular.
-- Avatar of the Eclipse paths F2S2 ->F1S2, increased Enc score.
-- Increased Irekle recruitment point costs and +5 gold costs total (60g), added Dominion requirement for recruitment.
-- Reduced invulnerability, darkpower and significantly increased Enc scores,
-- One buff: all non-Almashtyru sacreds now start out younger (the land-bound get the short end of the stick).
-- --		MA
-- Replaced Bronze Cuirass with Bronze Scale Hauberk keeping in line with other troops. Sacreds still pretty awful since can only keep the line.
-- Replaced starting army with fully amphibious troops (even if Skirmishers are weak)
-- --		LA
-- Stripped Shadow Cloth Armor from Warriors of the Veil.
-- --	--	Chasos
-- Added Glyph of the Omen pretender
-- Improved molten ore event chances.
-- --		EA
-- Bonegnawers carry a short bow and not javelins (now similar function to Wildkin Hunters, but better melee and unrest)
-- Added missing AI tags of blood nation.
-- --		MA
-- Added The Unmaking spell which strikes units and population in the province. Alt 9 S7 spell which also kills caster.
-- Added Schismancers, F1 + FED +0.20 AWSB mages. Still stealthy as everything else in Chasos; a Jar of Fire raiders you never thought to be afraid of.
-- --	--	Ochreil
-- --		MA
-- Increased Karakan Warrior price to 55 gold (still badass regenerators who want E5 bless)
-- Ochrezhan are djinns
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Underwater Wave/Shore Warriors get Stone Lances instead of Stone Spears.
-- Removed Deep Sea requirement for Primordial Kryluds
-- --	--	Zel, early age
-- Not designed yet. A desert nation still, still turns into horrors of sand in MA, and still has Sorcerers of the Sand, but details may differ.
-- Is a candidate for +1 Fire or Astral bless points.
-- Middle age version will be abusing dominion immortality like crazy, but I'll probably add upkeep this time
-- --***	END VERSION

-- --***	VERSION 0.97
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Added incorrectly implemented Kryluds. The water movement does not match at all.
--		TODO
-- Arcanian Spectre sprite. NOT DONE.
-- Expand on Dragenheim troops, too few; add wolves and polar seals if all else fails.
-- Tie LA Drakonia to Chasos disaster.
-- DO SOMETHING ABOUT DRAGENHEIM! Bugged lingering or not, they have the worst troop diversity, little lore ties,
-- and even if communion-capable their mages are limited.
-- --	--	Arcania/Cannum
-- Lowered MR scores, weakened Ether Surge, removed most Grow Magic Scales.
-- Added Arcanian Spectre, a Twiceborn chassis (for all it is a Spectre).
-- EA base mages are S2 + AESD, not S3+AED.
-- Blacksteel Champions use Blacksteel Plate by default (lower base prot, better enc, but all prices still same)
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- Removed forge bonus from Warsmiths of all ages. Make do with expensive items! Resource bonus increased 7 -> 10 though.
-- --		LA
-- Brutannic Berserkers cost 20 gold now.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Removed def penalty from small wolf bite (helps all cavalry), added missing MR score to archers, psycho goblin and flame warrior +gcost again.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- --	--	Dassem
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Correctly enabled BLood for Earth (which was missing for a while already)
-- Removed natural regeneration from bloodvine men/ogres, but spells summon +1 more.
-- --		EA
-- Removed scale shift from Blood Fecundity event
-- Increased base rpcost for all troops, reducing their final rpcost 10 -> 8 (was too difficult to expand)
-- --		LA
-- Hungry Reapers 65->80gcost, okleaders.
-- Dominion senses corpses (it didn't)
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Disabled deviltaurs since those didn't have any real lore base (unlike Celestial or Copper minotaurs)
-- Lowered all defense scores for cavemen (like Horim), removed forge bonus for MA mages.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Branded Smiths downgraded from E2 +0.1FED to E1 + FED; price reduced, but much less combat-mages
-- --		LA
-- Ruthum Smiths are cap-only now, since their magic access is so good. Nation now only has ED2 FN1 outside of capital, plus sacreds.
-- --	--	Impros
-- Removed forge bonus from smiths as Brutannic descendants. Angel Princes still have it (for 510g rainbows they're sure not economic anyhow).
-- Removed order scale growth from H3 cap-only mages.
-- --		LA
-- Removed Death magic pretenders from new Greek patch.
-- --	--	Tetracheires
-- --		EA
-- Increased mage-priest prices to 185/205 gold
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- --	--	Nod
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- Nerfed nearly all troops by -1 att and def, to match Abysian stats 
--(their baseline was buffed because of EA afflctions; reduced EA troops price to 6/9 gold instead so they can halfway compete with Temple Warriors).
-- Giants and abysians were inadvertedly buffed, since they retained both high cost and high stats (and 60% affliction rate).
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- --		LA
-- Iron Skirmishers with javelins on land walls. Not recruitable.
-- --	--	Chasos
-- --	EA
-- Beast Mastery for Idol of Carrion.
-- Marauders of Woe 19->18g cost.
-- Fortunrest 5->6
-- --	--	Ochreil
-- All of Ochreyuans 30g->25g basecost, except Karakans who still cost 45 (they're that awesome)
-- Added a Trial of Karakans which transforms W1 herald into W1D1 cap-only herald, with risk of death.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Rewrite late age lore to reflect them competing with Ochreil down below, and taking over ruins of Zel.
-- Non-cap magic severely reduced, sacreds are cheaper (60g->55g).
-- Add MA good commander.

-- Not designed yet. A desert nation still, still turns into horrors of sand in MA, and still has Sorcerers of the Sand, but details may differ.

-- --***	VERSION 0.95
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Meditated on bless points. Nobody got many.
-- Some fornations replaced with domowners, most importantly Swarmhive for their Oppression global.
-- (any temple with their dominion counts for oppression, but that's still really not my fault).
-- Tweaked Devilguard description.
--		TODO
-- Expand on Dragenheim troops, too few; add wolves and polar seals if all else fails.
-- Tie LA Drakonia to Chasos disaster.
-- --	--	Arcania/Cannum
-- Blacksteel Champions 250g -> 275g recruitment
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Mercenary price penalty 50% for marmec nations, 25% for MA swarm. Hits where it hurts (early game).
-- Correctly magical Godsworn Cuirass, and upgraded LA sacred infantry with it (+1 prot, +1 rcost)
-- Increased range and AOE for Prowess of the Hive; no longer self-buff but gem-free Unholy Power+Quickness. 
-- Only works off cap-only mages or communions (60 fatigue is a lot). Might warrant sacred nerfing, but I never could recruit enough S1H1 priests.
-- Switched buff levels from 4-5 to 3-5 and reversed research order.
-- (Unholy Power first, Quickness second); this delays mass Quickness till late late game, but allows early UP.
-- All prec 100 spells are correctly prec 100.
-- Fort defenders 6x mindblasters -> 4x minblasters and 4x Warriors (acid spitting on land in short range), LA swarm ->8+4 hum/myrm
-- Final bless bonus point distribution: S1N2, N2, N2 for Swarm and S1N1 S1W1 for Aboleth.
-- Now their Magic Weapons and Regeneration blesses are much cheaper for EA, and slightly more affordable in MA/LA; picking Crystal is nobrainer.
-- LA Abo gets short end of stick with worthless water point (nothing buffs Marmecoleths) but their cap diversity is better..
-- Slightly tweaked Rise of Swarmhive, dominion raises PD up to 19 outside forts and up to 50-51 within forts (+2 per month). 
-- Within dominion: unrest -2, income +10%, pop +20; price lowered to 50 pearls since it's nowhere near Fata Morgana and is path-intensive.
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- Felhounds no longer have a raiseonkill bite.
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- +1 F/B early age bless points, +1 B late. Not very important in the scope of Mictlanesque megabless EA can afford and bothersome scale demands of LA.
-- (with their inquisitors it's even better than bloodsac at killing enemy candles swiftly)
-- Added extra attacks for bigger heralds of doom.
-- --	LA
-- Reduced Small Area Doom damage by 2, and it now applies MR-negate Shredded Soul effect first (can wound immortals and mark them for death unless healed)
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Removed def penalty from small wolf bite (helps all cavalry), added missing MR score to archers, psycho goblin and flame warrior +gcost again.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- --	EA
-- +1 Air bless point. Basically +1 precision or even more shockres (since shock *does* some damage to basic size 3 giants)
-- --		Dassem
-- Pirate Marksmen morale reduced 8 -> 7 as per description. Still unpleasantly strong unit for a 'military-free' nation
-- Czaatch hero revised according to new Ochreil template; is a fire resistant demon who hates all other elements including poison; 
-- More mobile, regenerates natively and arrives with Melquart-esque popkill and unrest bundle, still E2B3 mage otherwise. Latehero 15 since strong.
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Corpse Darts poison 50->20 (less stun), rcost 2 ->1.
-- +3 Blood / 1 Earth+Blood / 2 Death bless points. 
-- Doesn't change much for EA since +strength or +hp aren't exactly valuable for them; 
-- but +2 points allow memetic +8 strength bless for mere E5B5 and more Undying on Late age.
-- Also, EA Robbledoth events now target friendly *dominion*, not provinces.
-- This results in their lands being more fun to conquer, spamming worthless trash and demanding >1 PD to deal with.
-- Added famine events for EA and MA if no Blood Fecundity, 1-5 dominion and no temple available, 10% chance - a handicap.
-- EA Soil Guards price reduced ->18g.
-- MA Harvester Acolytes are good leaders, price discount but still 100g -> 115g
-- LA living people were too young, added 10ish years.
-- LA increased MR for bigger mages
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- +2/1/0 Fire bless points as per Cult of Fire influence.
-- Attack and fire resistance aren't something you lack, but sacred aura can be bought instead for 4-5 fire.
-- --	--	Impros
-- +1/2 Astral bless points. At most allows magic weapons which helps against ethereals, but that's about it.
-- PD altered: base 3 units (10 slinger/10 auxilla/ 3 sagittarius)
-- Forts have merely 15 legionnaires, walls have mixed 6archers/6crossbows
-- --	--	Tetrachires
-- --	MA
-- Dominion assassinates blood 2 and death 2 mages as bad common event.
-- Lowered research for MA/LA Smiths by 2 more points since E2 mages are valuable commodity for attack freaks of Tetracheires.
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- --	LA
-- Renamed Drakengards to Drakechasers, added Chasos references (paths are nearly identical anyway and Astral aversion is justified)
-- --	--	Nod
-- Some event tweaks
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- All High Priests are expert leaders; price increased so they aren't cheaper than X1Y1H2 +XY combat mage-priests
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- +1 Fire bless points, +2/0/1 Astral bless points, +0/1/0 Nature bless points
-- Corrected their Shadow Cloth Armor and tied it with Kellarweavers of Ochrekoyash, it's magic armor of pretty good quality now (think Shroud)
-- Replaced all instances of Reinforced Cloth Armor with Flexkellar Cuirasses, upgrade because it's magic armor. Sprites updated too.
-- Sikherche-beks and Tyru Sikherches gained flexkellar, worse enc better prot and different sprite (no longer nigh-identical)
-- Desert Ku innate resistances lowered 5 -> 4.
-- Cavern Ku no longer throw rocks.
-- Ku Impalers correctly have 9 attack and not 9 enc compared to carvers/skirmishers; plus flexkellar upgrade of course.
-- LA flag color changed to no longer match Ochreil (who still have nigh-identical color scheme)
-- --	--	Chasos
-- Raiding event chain is based off dominion score, and dom 0 owned provinces, not just owned provinces
-- (so even cap-locked Chasos can still cause huge wildkin attacks in the vicinity through bloodsac)
-- Fixed pantheon for EA, thinking on MA.
-- Added Molten Ore Chunk events for EA and MA, not that MA has any chances finding it. Only happens for these nations, a free 20% forgebonus item and FE gemboost.
-- Added two Spellwoven armor pieces. Brutannia inherits all of the Chasos items now.
-- EA has discounted idol pretenders as per theme.
-- --	--	Ochreil
-- Added.
-- Remaining todo: DONE! Release today, not tomorrow, since even sprites are done. All in all four days' work, after balance was shaken down.
-- Lineup: hurlers, carvers/cleavers, impalers/vanguard. Hurl Rocks is pretty good wall weapon but range fixed at 7 and ammo is 3.
-- No bless points. Despite H3s and religious motifs.
-- --	--	Zel, early age
-- Not designed yet. A desert nation still, still turns into horrors of sand in MA, and still has Sorcerers of the Sand, but details may differ.
-- Is a candidate for +1 Fire or Astral bless points.

-- Reverted fort price/resprod to 25% bonus.
-- --	MA
-- Not completely finished - still ironing out the problems with foreign recruitment (same fortera 1, and +25 price penalty, but no +25 resprod like EA)
-- Survivors of the Sands and Sandstriders as wasterecruits instead of Brutusians (who ain't here anymore at all).
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- No changes whatsoever (you can't count Crowns of Avatars turning into Magic Crowns as a meaningful change, can you?)
-- --	--	Electrum
-- Added. LA is now a Hybrid-ruled kingdom, EA lost H3 access and large giants are more expensive. In short: Barbarians ftw, since giants have huge ranged DPS.
-- --***	END VERSION

-- --***	VERSION 0.15
-- Pyrgor was added, pretty heavily redesigned (that's not the first time it gets changed)
-- Everyone received proper fort defenders. Underwater PD still remains crippled and weird for everyone, so nah.
-- IDs were rearranged, so expect Brutannia (new id 178) to be broken if you're upgrading midgame.
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- --	--	Arcania / Cannum
-- --	EA
-- Phantasmal Longbow fires triple-hit arrows. Not useful against most humans, but low-MR high-HP/high-prot enemies will be killed faster
-- Phantasmal Sword added as bonus attack for all Phantasmals.
-- Re-added Phantasmal Archers as troops.
-- Everyone uses Arcanian Shields instead of Spectral ones, except ghosts. It has lower rcost which is relevant for Arcanian Riders.
-- Star Arcanians now have spiritsight like Ether Warriors do, Star Guards cost 180->160g
-- Magicians lost 1 random, now S3 + AED.
-- --	LA
-- Returned have Spirit Sight. Priestesses have #reanimpriest 1; whoever tests them, please tell what they reanimate if it's something weird.
-- --	--	Horde
-- Fort defender Throwers.
-- Nathrezim gained #heal, to account for severe nerf of the immortality (they're less powerful than Eredars).
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Wall defender Soldiers and Troopers, and Archers for human LA.
-- Terra Godborn price 45->40g
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- Spirits of War have gained #woundfend 99 and #float.
-- All magicless commanders have lower #fixedresearch scores, to account for 2/turn recruitment.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Added. You can read about changes in design notes.

-- All are immortal, and have same base stats. Lowered hp -> 15/30/45.
-- EA Omen
-- The Cult of the Omen is widespread in the kingdom of Zel. Its followers often disguise as dousers who search for water in the hot desert, but in truth their dousing often takes a far more sinister turn when they search for sacrifices in the honor of their Lord. The Acolytes and Priests of the Omen are rumored to possess miraculous powers of scrying and healing, but the Cult never shares these secrets with outsiders willingly.
-- MA Omen:
-- With the fall of Zel, the Cult of the Omen has scattered across many kingdoms. They found refuge among humans of neighbouring nations, 
-- in particular Brutannia, Cannum, Dassem, Electrum and Vilium. With sacrifice of innocents, their acolytes and masters can be enticed to serve the false pretenders. 
-- The Cult of the Omen pursues its own hidden agenda, and a wise pretender will not employ th
-- Acolyte of the Omen B2 blood 4 spell for 25 slaves - B1 +0.5 WSB heretic 2, douse 1 spy, researchbonus -4, gcost 10050, heal.
-- Priest of the Omen B3 blood 7 spell for 60 slaves - W1S1B2 + 1.0 WSB heretic 4, douse 2 spy, researchbonus -4, gcost 10050, heal.
-- Acolytes and Priests have 1% and 2% to start manifestation of the Omen chain.
-- First, a flag is set in province.
-- Second, 10% chance for the flag to trigger follow-up attack and 
-- Bad omens are followed up with attack of Manifestations; luck 2+ only triggers size 2, luck -1 - +1 size 4, luck -3 attracts size 6.
-- All of Manifestations will summon 1 themselves turn upon turn, popkill 5x size and unrest 5x size.

-- --***	VERSION 0.14
-- First Dom5 release. Very lacking modding support hurts a lot. Currently redesigning everything poorly made, and updating bad sprites.

-- Added. Some sprite tweaks (mostly EA), significantly altered EA lineup (no sacreds) and rewritten several MA/LA texts.
-- Todo: fort defenders.
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Added. A lot of tweaks to EA, and Abolethive; flags are somewhat different now.
-- Todo: fort defenders, UW fort defenders, bless points, S2 for all but LA Swarmhive, +different WEN bonus (W/N abolethive, E/N swarmhive). 
-- Todo: Cave income bonus 10% for all versions.
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- Added EA version. Some tweaks, Spirits of War are now invisible (not stealthy) and immortal but cost more slaves. Can be killed with magic (weapons) easily otherwise.
-- Todo: fort defenders, bless points F2B1?
-- --	--	Horde
-- Added. Hero sprites were added. Summon prices tweaked. Recruitment tweaks (Fel Orc Cultists now require Pit Lord and are stronger, but Shamans still don't)

-- --	--	TODO from dom4 changelog
-- Cannum alchemist hero. Nod, Vilium heroes.
-- Dragon Heart spell transformation instead of events (makes Feral Dragons salvageable, among other benefits?)
-- Battle Brew for EA Brutannia - the one-handed Brutal Strike-granting mug of brew, const 2 F1B1, grants bless and bers 3.
-- Add a Call to Arms banner hero template. After all, why not? I don't recall exact legend about some army moving fast;  Hannibal and Alps work if everything fails - he's early Rome anyway.
-- Tie Cannum Magicians and LA Brutannia - done
-- Work on Cannum, Ruthum, Ochrekan and Vilium - done?
-- Tied Hegude, Cannum, Vilium and Brutannia through Order of prismatic light - somewhat done
-- Added Arcanian hero of the Prismatic Order for LA Hegude - done
-- Add Ruthum-Ochrekan interaction?
-- Add event chain for Dragenheim Civil War(?).
