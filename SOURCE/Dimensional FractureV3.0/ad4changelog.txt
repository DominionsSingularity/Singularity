-- Cannum alchemist hero. Nod, Vilium heroes.
-- GILLS FOR LINDWURM
-- Dragon Heart spell transformation instead of events (makes Feral Dragons salvageable, among other benefits?)
-- Almashtyru Dome can be cast UW
-- Battle Brew for EA Brutannia - the one-handed Brutal Strike-granting mug of brew, const 2 F1B1, grants bless and bers 3.
-- Add a Call to Arms banner hero template. After all, why not? I don't recall exact legend about some army moving fast;  Hannibal and Alps work if everything fails - he's early Rome anyway
-- Tie Cannum Magicians and LA Brutannia - done
-- Work on Cannum, Ruthum, Ochrekan and Vilium - done?
-- Tied Hegude, Cannum, Vilium and Brutannia through Order of prismatic light - somewhat done
-- Added Arcanian hero of the Prismatic Order for LA Hegude - done
-- Add Ruthum-Ochrekan interaction?
-- Add event chain for Dragenheim Civil War(?).

-- --	--	Whatever adds here.
-- --***	VERSION 1.31
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Pending upgrade to Dom5 (I'm still on the fence about buying it just now), I'm wracking my mind as to what stuff demands redeisgn.
-- Arcania, more giants in EA and make the nation make more sense. WILL be the first nation to be ported to D5.
-- Swarm/Aboleth -hives, their high res price -> recpoints (something like 2/4/6 res, and 2/8/32 recpoints)
-- EA/LA Brutannia/MA Zel, I'm not happy with current Spirits of War and Heralds of Doom. Also Manifestations of the Omen.
-- MA Brutannia, will see if Dom5 allows treating pseudo-nomadic nations better and the compoints hurt a lot.
-- Tetrachires, are they overpowered? In D4 their first strike pretty much won battle unless skelespam.
-- Dassem, how does it function now?
-- Nod, Vilium: get my shit together and add them heroes. At least Tratos. That lone Vilium golem is embarrassing.
-- Pyrgdor: do goblins work at all with increased protection in Dom5? EA/MA relied on Psycho Goblins a lot.
-- Electrum: see if the giants require price reduction to match Avvim, or their huge shockres/stormimmunity make up for it. Watch Archers.
-- MA Sandeth: scrap that pile of junk into something workable using immortality. Does Reform work?
-- Ochrekan: they're fine. Probably. The MM change might make them less competitive, since they'll still remain utterly immobile. Prec boost may be justified since freaking ants have same prec.
-- Drakonia: what a mess. 
-- Sukarakoyash: keep harrassing Illwinter by plotting sinister conspiracies, inspiring malicious shitposters, and do nothing until they implement UW PD.
-- Krylud: look above. Other than that, the new bless system will help the rainbless sacreds not suck.
-- Ruthum: ...do they work OK? More importantly, do they steamroll everything?
-- Nod: do I fix what's no broken?
-- MA Horde: boring, boring WCI-III orcs. I'd rather finally make sprites for Azeroth first. HERO SPRITES.
-- Icedgarth: make them more Dominionsy. They're currently... well, OK, they do work but not perfectly.
-- Hegude: I don't recall there being many problems, apart from Divine Cleansing in LA being utterly awesome.
-- Malevil: ...too generic. Need some solid basis to strongarm the design into, and thusly rework the nation around initial concept.
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- 1 sprite all told.
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Fixed Ether Latch (-4 def -> -4 att)
-- Added const 6 A2N1 Myrmec Wings, for more flying shits and giggles (albeit worse than Winged Shoes)
-- Fixed Rise of Swarmhive to cause correct income increase, and tweaked freespawn. 
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --	EA
-- Brutal Fire turned into Fire Shield buff (Dom5 will have it reverted back... probly)
-- Increased Spirit of War price, and Become Spirit of War too (they're... goddamn SC, at 4 stars)
-- Spirits of War gained dmg 12 Fire Flare (they were losing it compared to Disciples of Brutus)
-- Reduced troop prices by 1 point (13g->12g, etc), because cuirass are craptastic.
-- Young Warriors/Bowmen are foreign recruits.
-- Warsmith fire random 20->10%; for Witches ADN 20% and SWE 10% randoms per type.
-- --	--	Electrum

-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum
-- Partial redesign.
-- --		EA
-- Slightly reduced non-mage commander MR.
-- Only Star Guards as cap-only unit, now basically sacred Ether Warriors for 200g each. 
-- Blacksteel Champions and Star Elders are size 3 Ether Warrior lookalikes. 
-- Weapon/slots overhaul, no more knights in EA.
-- Phantasmal are size 2 still. Added W random to non-Star Elder cap-only recruits? Maybe other paths for Phantasmal (N/B as Sidhe, Vanir connection? Too good?)
-- Star Elders have S4?2 -> S3D2?1 like good ol' Ether Lords they descend from. Basically no more native S5, but severely improved teledrop skelespam.

-- --	--	Whatever adds here.
-- --***	VERSION 1.30
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Everything went splat. I mean, I reshuffled pretty much everything so I've no idea what changes got chewed up. There were a lot of pretender access changes, Devil Guards are summonable for all nations using Master of Contracts and vice versa, and stuff, but... you get the picture. Nothing major comes to mind anyway.
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Ether Myrmecs scale once again (7+ instead of 7 summons; sacreds are better anyway)
-- Fixed Marmec/Myrmec evokers primary randoms (so they've got W1/E1 S1 + FAWE magic; need to go UW for W2 magic, but got twice as many useful E2S1 carapacitors)
-- Swarm Evokers are now philosophers too.
-- Update LA Swarm Guardian/Knight sprites with more distinctive helmets
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- Removed crosspaths from Brutannic Witches and Slave Witches (99% chance for WES instead; research less powerful)
-- Mageknights have lower stats
-- --	--	Electrum
-- Tied up with Brutannia/Zel lorewise; added Bronze Sage hero (FAW1 E3 H1 hero crafter)
-- --		LA
-- Removed slash resistance from Constructs (only pierce, kinda hard to mess up schemes point-by-point); Icicle Constructs are resistant to nothing because fragile ice.
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth
-- Omen-marked messengers are poor amphibians
-- --	--	Dassem
-- Increased Demon Pact requirements to B5E1 and price to 24 slaves (you're going to empower someone, and only EA really suffers... for all total of two bloodhunting turns for 60-120 slaves empowerment).
-- Remove national extremely powerful PD boost and leave at standard +1/turn? Make the event rare? Reduced, but not removed
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum
-- --		MA
-- Sacreds morale 11->13 (elites)
-- --	--	Tetrachires
-- Added Xyrgon unique sprite.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Cleaned up the #copyspells
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Renamed Black Elders to Black Captains; skewed leadership ability towards undead
-- Activated domkill for 0.1% per candle (it was spelled *wrong* and didn't work).
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- More ethereal summons are #neednoteat: -ertkych, -ajdaha and kulege chapkyn.
-- EA lost Olug-beks, and descriptions were rewritten to account for lore.
-- Renamed Blessing of Akkoyash to Warding of Akkoyash.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Shark Priests gained fixedresearch 5 and researchbonus -2, thus they're all equally poor researchers
-- Shark Amulet is EA/MA like Shark Kryluds.
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Celestial Ascendants correctly cause unrest 10
-- --	--	Hegude
-- Changed Great Swords to Consecrated ones, +1 rcost, +1 atk, non-rustable
-- Changed Consecrated Swords, -2 dmg, -2 rcost. Pending upgrade to Dom5 with its S2 Magic Weapons, removed this quality outright - numbing light is nice enough.
-- --		MA
-- Send Angel of Death D4W1, 10 gems -> D4W2, 12 gems, conj 7-> conj 8. Summons -> D4W2 too. It's manageable goal, with Kokyhtiads.
-- Rewritten their lore to be more cohesive and not contradictory with basically everything.
-- Now you need to plan or eat one empowerment to break into high death.
-- --	--	Ochrehulk
-- Separated Glacierhulks and Crystal Giants spells for MA/LA; only Frosthulks in both ages.
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil
-- Renamed EA to Malevil.
-- Removed puppet freespawn from Father of Idols, reducing its price.
-- --	--	Icedgarth

-- Swarmhive pret/item
-- Brutannic summons, MA Zel
-- Saltwater ochres
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Upgraded Corrosive Spit with 10->11 dmg, 0->2 prec (so prec 5 Myrmecs don't fire wildly off target as often, AOE corrosion or not)
-- Enabled Gargantuan Myrmecs for everyone and removed site restriction
-- Added Crystal of the Hive as pretender, E1S1N2 immobile. Replaces Monolith for all but LA Swarmhive. Price same despite +1N since mostly combat-incapable unlike Monolith.
-- Description summaries reflect inverted lab/temple prices
-- Added Myrmec Tunnelling E2S1 cave range 8 2 gem teleport and Tunneler's gear with gem-free Tunnelling plus retinue
-- --		EA/MA
-- Lesser Godborn price 16->10g, summon 8->6 gems (no offensive power at all, N9-charged spell decoys)
-- --		LA
-- Knights att/def +1 (11->12 unsacred, 12->13 sacred)
-- Generals +2 hp 13->15
-- Godsworn Knights/Myrmecs poisonres 3->5
-- Swarm Generals not inspirational (godsworn still are)
-- --		Abolethive
-- Twiceborn Abodai can use 3 misc and Aboleth items, summonable for LA
-- Removed poison cloud from Necrotic Leech, non-usable by undead
-- Added Prehensile Tentacle variation useable by any living, animate being; essentially budget Copper Arm.
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --		EA
-- Prophet and Demon Knight/Mordred got twohanded Dark Fire Sword - very killy singletarget item, but incompatible with shield.
-- Size 4-6 Spirits of War have fear 5.
-- Improved PD by adding more bowmen,
-- --		MA
-- Removed independent scouts from lineup (use Warsmiths instead)
-- --		LA
-- Omenblades and Doomblades are no longer AP, but rather cause Curse Luck with mrnegeasily (thug-killer).
-- Brutannic Guardians use Omenblades of MA Zel.
-- Added Omen-Marked Spectres as coastal summons; spectres, with two FAWES1 summonable generals from Conj 8 Army.
-- Improved undead leadership for DOomsayers to match Warlocks. They are also not drainimmune.
-- Renamed Doomsayer Elder to Elder of the Omen.
-- Size 4-6 Heralds of Doom have fear 5.
-- Added architect-slaying event (turns to frog and kills, buffs dominion)
-- Added MA Zel national spell.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- Corrected Bronze Crafter events as common bad
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth
-- Added living MA Zel counterpart, precedessor of Brutannia. Nation has decent recruit-anywhere mages, but troops are all horrid ringmailers.
-- Vizier price 475->500g
-- Sand Hyena 13g->14g, ap 28->20, Sand Vulture 13g->12g
-- Zervan D2 -> D3 magic

-- --	--	Whatever adds here.
-- --***	VERSION 1.28
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Swarmhive got two of 4915-4916 ID back from heroes who were moved to 6043-6044
-- A BIG grammar fix
-- 5007-5009 id, 5061, 5084 are cleared.
-- Diablo II mods are *once again* not finished, but hopefully... by 1.29?
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- Nostradamus, the Cannum/Brutannia hero.
-- Brutannia (ringmail footman/sniper, boot taskmaster, warmaiden, Nostradamus). 
-- Add Empowered Champion monstrous pretender with dom2 (to pair with Avatar of Doom)?
-- Arcania (LA cannum guard, necroapprentice, Nostradamus)
-- Riverlight (solar priest, prism mage/warrior)
-- Kryluds (elites horn, dryseer, drypriest)
-- Robbledoth (la priest)
-- Goblins (la lancer)
-- Swarmhive (ether myrmec)
-- Drakonia (bog dragon, sword slave)
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive (actual, honest-to-god nerfs! I swear, they were here... maybe*)
-- Myrmec King paths altered to S2N1 -> E1S1N1 (now a semi-viable rainbow E4S5N4	 who's still overpriced for bless chassis)
-- Pyroborn and Aquaborn use non-AP bite weapons now now, though still magical.
-- Custom Venomous Bite versions are affected by Flaming and Death weapons.
-- Corrected Myrmec Godvoice rcost 15->30 (2 Warworkers = 24)
-- Workers rcost 3 -> 2 (now it's possible to recruit 50-100ish workers in a fort about to be besieged and laugh with extra 68-136 siege strength, and add 240g packs as necessary)
-- Revamped pretenders, mostly african -> middle east. Errors might have been made.
-- Added Terra Godborn - so you can keep digging size 3. Lower attrition than other Godborn, but 2x rcost and 1,5x gcost; summon 14+ for E2 spell against 21+ for X1 spell of other paths.
-- Added Ether Myrmecs, mor 30 summonable magicpowered Myrmecs. Better than Ether Warriors because cheaper (7 for 20 vs 15 for 90).
-- Lesser Godborn have W1N1 path now (...er, I dunno why; Clams are only vital for LA without W/N crosspath, but they aren't there anyway)
-- Improved 'rmec Evokers research scores, price not changed (now 11 for 200g... this is still bad of course, but not below-Vanheim-tier bad anymore)
-- Corrected Ancient Queen Eerie siege, castledef and supply (20->50/10->40/10->1)
-- Bronze Carapace fire resistance bonus improved (to account for removed built-in FR; technically +5 SR/15 FR result)
-- DIDN'T ADD Found Swarmhive Court and Found Marmecodai Outer Hive. Both spells are const 7 for 30 pearls and relieve cap-only tension; the eventual +2000 population boom is also nice.
-- Fortify Cave is a Construction spell now.
-- Rise of Swarmhive only spawns troops within forts, but chance is 50% to old 20% (a fully forted land will net a LOT of small ants). Gold requirement increased to 500 (so they don't quite bankrupt you through upkeep).
-- --		LA
-- Queens have AE + S2N2 + AESN magic now; less A2, higher chance of E2 and A1E1 (to Rain the Stones on everyone, not that Evo is nationally important research school).
-- Reduced archers morale and diverged infantry costs to 10/12g - no more underpriced 11g elite units, and composite bows are meh for LA. Warworkers bite better anyhow with corosion and whatnot.
-- Further discount for Godsworn Infantry, cost 18g now.
-- Swarm Generals have Godsworn General prophetshape.
-- Godsworn Myrmecs don't disrupt formation fighter.
-- Marmecodai Princess have double tentacles (they're weak regardless)
-- --	--	Brutannia (oddly enough, buffed; they're fairly vulnerable until sacreds are trained)
-- FINALLY SWAPPED ID of EA and LA; 147 is EA, and 149 is LA as proper
-- --		EA
-- Largest Spirit of War has +2 Holy boost.
-- Skull Necklacez replaced with Brutal Brew, 5-slave worth Brutal Power/Bless/Berserk item (a Demon Knight can Ebuff itself anyhow and get extra Ironskin to boot, so it's not worth using for them)
-- Added Become Spirit of War to replace Brand of Brutuz; needs one Blood booster to pull it off for Disciples.
-- --		MA
-- Witch Valkyrie doesn't use ice, but enchanted weapons instead.
-- --		LA
-- Added Brutannic Warmaidens (15g chaosrec amazons with poison spears, stealthy blockers to combine with Snipers)
-- Added Doomsteed summons; armored poisonbreathing horses to bolster Knights
-- Added Nostradamus hero, S4 D1 N1 B4.
-- Replaced Scale Mail Cuirasses with Ring Mail Hauberks (affected Footmen, Amazons and Snipers; Warmaidens are new)
-- Vanguards def 11->12, Legionnaires att/prec 10->11.
-- Removed Snipers reclimit altogether; their high gcost should work better (and unlike 25g Poison slingers, they can only hit 1 target every 3 turns, if really painfully)
-- Equalized Mageknight/Knights prices at 75g. Inferior stats/defense and lack of shield make up for swarm/flames/lightning/mindblast.
-- Slave Witches researchbonus -3-> -2
-- Warsmiths mm 2 and resprod 10, like Ulmish smiths. The nation is painfully hit with expensive fortera 2, despite xpshape demanding some degree of turtling.
-- Moodmen have FAWESB paths, all 16% chance and researchbonus -4. Reduced unrest generation 1.5 -> 1 for the Doomsworn Moodman, increased 0.5->1 for Brutannic one
-- Largest Heralds of Doom should get holy boost; the smaller ones shouldn't.
-- Empower Champions summons 3 champions for 50 pearls now.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- Thunder Lance item att 4->5
-- Lowered Skirmisher/Bronze Warrior/Ironclad warrior costs 25/27/30 -> 22/25/27.
-- --		EA
-- Thunder Elders have higher random 20% chance (they're old and experienced, not totally impotent)
-- --		MA
-- Ironclad Warriors are no longer coast-only.
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth
-- --		EA
-- Added missing wastesurvival for Sandstorm Zealots.
-- Tweaked Solar Spirit stats so they are stronger than Flame Spirits unless in darkness.
-- Corrected Solar Heat requirements.
-- Increased Solar Sorcerer random chance to 20% for 5% chance of an F4
-- Once again reverted Solar Striders to noslowrec battlemages with F3S1H2 magic (the bulk of troops are going to be Sand Sorc/Astrologers anyhow). Reduced leadership 120->80.
-- --		MA
-- Sands of Past only require source wastelands.
-- --	--	Dassem
-- --		EA
-- Pledged Demonologists are rec-everywhere (not that you should do it at all, unless to get F2/E2 random).
-- --		MA/LA
-- Parians mr 12->9 (monkeys; they're too good with scalewalls otherwise)
-- Prices of C'tissasins increased by +5 - 110g; reason being 6/1-gem water and astral trinkets like Bottle of Water.
-- Sidhe Navigators price +10g -> 130g
-- Added Kalanagas for LA swamp recruitment (W1 + 0.5 ESN waterboosted stealthy snakes). Not assassins and bad researchers, but very strong water elementing. With Black Heart+bottle can frozenheart anyone.
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum (buffs for EA, nerfs for MA/LA)
-- Reduced taskmastery bonus to +1 (serfs are coward)
-- Corrected national remote sitesearching spells
-- Added stronger lore ties to Brutannia, with same paths, hero Nostradamus and whatnot.
-- Heightened Ether Surge, now +3 Magic scale (for a 15-pearl spell that's still not much, given that 10 pearls worth are caused by Lesser Horror attack at Alt4)
-- --		EA
-- Arcanians base att/def 11 -> 12; elites unchanged.
-- Phantasmal hp/str reduced to baseline
-- Star Guard att 12->13
-- Removed Rider reclimit (cavalry aplenty)
-- Added Spying ability to Priestesses and reduced price somewhat (still ended up expensive).
-- Reduced Magician research bonus to +4 for same 250g price (With PoTS there is little point in recruiting Apprentices, other than AESD1 forging and communion slaving)
-- Starting scout to Priestess.
-- Blacksteel Night -> E4S3 spell for 4 earth gems, because E2 Arcanians with +2 boost (pots/earthpower/boots) access are common. Turn 1 Darkness was a bit too strong for 3 gems; arcanians have a scary advantage of +7 over regular troops if they lack darkvision.
-- --		MA
-- Arcanians base att/def 11 -> 12.
-- Replaced Lightweight Scale with Chainmail Cuirass (+1 prot, -1 def compared to EA and lower rcost)
-- Added hero S4D1N1 Nostradamus for MA.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Heavy Cavalry replaced Full Scale with Chain Mail Hauberk (-1 enc, -rcost)
-- Altered Magician paths for FW + 1.1 FAWES and 2.1 FAWES (price down 210->200 for potential lack of X2).
-- Against better judgement, slowrecced both Great Magicians and Necromagicians. Starting research is still OK with 16rp Magicians, but... setting up a second fort became more important.
-- Increased research bonus for Great Magician to +8 to compensate.
-- --		LA
-- Magician Champion paths altered to FW + AESD. Those are nice crosspaths.
-- Added Necroapprentice, S1D1 stealthy researchbonus 2 mages.
-- Added Cannum Guard - 15g elite stealthy prot 12 medium infantry; longbow + dual short swords. Shieldless, but still very good at melee.
-- Added Cannum Captains, 60g stealthy inspirationals with kite shield and arcanian sword.
-- Cap-only magpower units ages tweaked to 100 max, and 60/70 starting.
-- Corrected Blacksteel Returned itemslots so it has feet and 3 misc.
-- Dithmirran gained cold and poisonres of a shade.
-- Returned Arcanians gained #tmpastralgems 1, for Power of the Spheres and stuff
-- --	--	Tetrachires (tweaks)
-- --		EA
-- Quadro Shaman paths changed to A1W1E1 + 2.1 FAWEN (less random, few crazy F2 thugs and no E3F1 magmaspammers, but it's just as well)
-- Quadro Elder hero paths changed to F1A1W1E1 + FAWEN3 (guaranteed X4 access or Megachires summoning capability)
-- --		MA
-- Reduced Hand of the Dau MR 16->15.
-- --		LA
-- Worsened Unholy Power scaling 2003 to 1004; Greater Unholy Power B5->B6 and it is Blood 9 spell (since really, Unholy power for ALL LIVING BEINGS? Swarmhive proves it... bites, and Tetras of all things...)
-- Reduced Ritual of Championship requirements B3S3 -> B3S1.
-- Reduced Tetrademon requirements B2S2 -> B2S1.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor (buffs for LA)
-- Goblin Flail gained charge bonus (Raider Warriors and Raider Lancers benefit)
-- Titan of Darkness has proper prot 3 for his titanic class.
-- Terrifying Shriek lost have secondary cold effect
-- Enabled Darksweeper makesummon for Greater Darksweepers (they are expensive enough)
-- Improved Bind Darksweepers scaling to 8++ (a D6 mage makes 16 per 10 gems)
-- Added +1 unit for Send Darksweepers and reduced cost to 25 gems (summoning either commander or a bunch of Darksweepers is still best if you don't have a shaman hidden to bless them)
-- Werepyrgs turned into Avatar of the Void creation chassis, with F1S1 + 2 FSNB.
-- Ka-Gormor chaospower 3->2, and base att/def +3 (so in O3 he gets down to str 14 att/def 12/15). Call spawns him at the edges of the battlefield and applies Divine Blessing as well.
-- Several Avatars gained H1 to selfbless.
-- Call Pyrghost and Pyrghost Pack are Conj 6/8 spells which summon units at edges for D3F1/D4F2 mages.
-- --		LA
-- Hobgoblin Crossbow range 30 -> 35
-- Spirit Warriors 30g -> 26g (they have basically no killing power, magical weapon aside)
-- Raider Archers 18->15g
-- Reduced hobgoblins gcost to 14; Commanders are goodleaders but command -20 for 95g; sappers str +1.
-- Curse of Hobgoblins gives +2 blesshp.
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Different flags for EA and LA - green border for EA and purple border for LA.
-- Fort of Ash and Bones price 35->30 gems because it's very short-ranged.
-- Wither World price reduced to 80 gems; added fort-only ghouls/thirsty freespawn
-- Chalice of Misery clouds 6->5
-- --		EA
-- Reduced Starved Ones price back to 4g. Everyone else - fighter/ranger/slasher - had their prices increased instead 7-9->8-10.
-- Soil Guard rcost 8->9.
-- Lisymachus got reinvigoration +4.
-- --		MA
-- Lowered xpshape to 3-stars for Harvesters.
-- --		LA
-- Removed slowrec from Hungry Wizards, now they are wildly overpriced at 290g but recruited quickly.
-- Thirsty legion now spawns 33+++ units using montag (fighter/ranger/slasher)
-- Hungry Elders have FEDNB main random instead of FEDB. Hungry Shamans have ESDNB both randoms.
-- Black Guard and Black Elder are upkeep-free (so you can amass an indefinite amount of those super-elite undead fort defenders
-- --	--	Drakonia (even more buffs)
-- Added mountain survival for all Green Dragonkin.
-- All Dragonkin Warriors prices set at 14g. Vandragen Huskarls remained at 16g because of magweapons.
-- Greatsword Barbarian Slaves cap downgraded (prothead -2, rcost 8->7)
-- Added Bog Dragons - an undead, amphibious Green Dragon requiring N3D3. Drakonia and MA Dragenheim only; it's difficult to scramble N3D3 caster.

-- No Dragonkin Tamers in every fort, swamp-only.

-- Bladragenjarls W3A1?1 -> W2A1?1. No more Atlantean-level magic overlands.

-- Irekle Manifestation upgraded to S3F2 spell (gem-price is the same, but is more difficult to mass early on)
-- Karadavyl and Akdavyl viziers: gained random magic, F2A2 and F1A3 base + FASD random. It hurt non-heroic ways to get FD, and especially for EA where Saladin is a must.
-- Corrected Ritual of Aksukarakoyash.
-- Dome of the Eclipse can be cast UW.
-- Call Black Reavers +4 units, +3 gem price.
-- Dim / Eyes of the Eclipse produce tmpgems.

-- Sky Seers price 80g->75g.
-- Shark Amulet 2->3 sharks (still inferior to imps of course)
-- --		EA
-- Deepseers/Prophecy Seers random paths WESD -> AWES (no Death magic access)
-- --		LA
-- Elites wield shortsword, not a morningstar (lower attrition, worse offense)
-- Altered Sky Seers to Dry Krylud Sky Seers (paths A1W1 -> A1S1, same 10% AWES, sailing -> 999/4 navigation)
-- Krylud Warlords are now slowrec, but still 200g superiorleaders with sailing 999/4 - can haul indies around. Not for expansion, though.
-- --	--	Ruthum (diversify)
-- Throw Rocks ammo 8 -> 15 (with maniacal laughter: let's stone them with flaming guided rocks in the darkness! Because seriously, that's a *viable tactic*. Maybe.)
-- Added Arch Deviltaurs (F4B4 Blood 7 summons with F3B3 magic. Absolutely nothing special; probably worth uniquefying)
-- --		MA
-- Renamed Axesworn Smiths to Firesworn Smiths.

-- --	--	Ochrehulk
-- Fixed Old Frostbound descr.

-- Drastically reduced homesickness to standard 10% (so troops aren't totally unusable)
-- ADDING some heroes.
-- Lowered Soulforge MR score to 15 (to represent them being bound)
-- Dawn/Sky/Hrafn are spirits now, summonable via N5 unique spell.
-- --		EA

-- Added Devilmen (F2D1B1H1 mages)
-- --		MA
-- Improved Dawn/Sky mages to X2 ?1 magic. Cost 155g

-- Honor Guard is ench 6, 55->50 gems price and merely D5 spell now. Added one Standard of the Seventh Tomb commander.
-- Removed upkeep from Reborns and Standards.
-- Immortals gained same reinvigoration as Reborns.
-- Marauders prices 12->11, 10->9 (they're undisciplined and low-morale and otherwise ineffective)
-- Bane Slings ammo 3->2 (too good against any short-aged elite troops; Ragha, Brutannia, Swarmhive and Vilium weep piteously)
-- Navigators gained S random (AD->ASD), so nation isn't like Caelum or Xibalba or both Drakonias - who are the only in LA without Astral access
-- --	--	Diablo II conversion
-- Added to modpack with all sprites and whatever
-- --	--	TODO
-- GILLS FOR LINDWURM
-- Dragon Heart spell transformation instead of events (makes Feral Dragons salvageable, among other benefits?)
-- Almashtyru Dome can be cast UW
-- Battle Brew for EA Brutannia - the one-handed Brutal Strike-granting mug of brew, const 2 F1B1, grants bless and bers 3.
-- Add a Call to Arms banner hero template. After all, why not? I don't recall exact legend about some army moving fast;  Hannibal and Alps work if everything fails - he's early Rome anyway
-- Tie Cannum Magicians and LA Brutannia - done
-- Work on Cannum, Ruthum, Ochrekan and Vilium - done?
-- Tied Hegude, Cannum, Vilium and Brutannia through Order of prismatic light - somewhat done

-- --	--	Whatever adds here.
-- --***	VERSION 1.27
-- Swarmhive hotfix:
-- Removed elemental resistances from most Myrmecs/marmecs; left them with poison resistance instead.
-- Twiceborn Abodai and Icedgarthian hero Crocell gained increased cold aura.
-- --		LA
-- Upgraded Swarm Infantry but kept price at 11g (they're still 33% weaker than fully buffed (quickness+stampede) Myrmecs)
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Added LA Abolethive. Now with 200% mindless troops!.. (who are fairly useless by the way)
-- Hopefully (?) added MA Kehjistan, Westmarch and Harrogath - Diablo II converted bestiaries.
-- Add heroes for EA Dassem, LA Quad-Zax. Make sprites for Horde heroes.
-- Expand on weapon diversity?.. Most nations already seem fine, though; Storm giants maybe deserve non-spear troops.
-- Tidy up the naming conventions (so no non-human races use spearmen etc.)
-- All sailors sailing size increased by 1, to account for Enlargement and/or allow taking extra size 1 troop along for the ride.
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive (PRETTY MUCH COMPLETE REDESIGN)
-- All Marmecs use slashing bite like Myrmecs.
-- Pincer Latch is now an dmg 1 AN weapon which will cause the target rust on damage, but has -3 -> -4 atk.
-- Size 1 troops lost Pincer Latch altogether (workers, Cosmo Godborn, Lesser godborn; Aero Godborn too (they have AN lightning instead)
-- Warworkers price 11->12 (corrosive attack *greatly* adds to their att 13-17 punch with Stampede and Onslaught buffs)
-- Increased all Controller/Enslaver etc. resource cost to 40 (2 Warworkers+ size 3 chassis = were too cheap)
-- Added landrec Myrmec Evokers for all Swarmhive ages (S1 + WE + FAWE poor researcher mages, non-amphibian Marmec Evoker equivalents)
-- All Queens have 2 warriors + 4 workers retinue (-2 supply, 20 siege, 10 castledef) and cost 395g/80r, except LA Marmecodai Princesses
-- (no longer as UW-dependent for diversity (which made *absolutely* no sense whatsoever) )
-- Brigadeers and most other size 2 humanoid Myrmecs don't have bite attack - only pincer latch
-- Altered PD, removing those useless Workers from lineup. Godvoices are fort commanders for EA.
-- Changed Protomarmec Princess paths to W1S1H1 + FWEN, cost 10->12 gems.
-- ...Actually, are they ever used at all beyond rapid xp conversion in capital and plentiful siege strength? Got +1 extra supply bonus; now they can feed 1,5 regular troops each.
-- Added +E and +S armor-slot Const 4 boosters to replace Earth Boots and Starshine Skullcap: E2 Rock-strong Carapce and E2S2 Crystalline Armor. Both have prot 15 armor.
-- Bronze Carapace paths changed E2N1 -> E2A1.
-- --		EA
-- Added Marmec Evokers for EA underwater
-- FINALLY added the Myrmec/Marmec Godvoice priests for EA/MA! Stealthy size 2 100g raiders with W/E/S1, the Marmecs continue living underwater in LA. 
-- --		EA/MA
-- Increased Aero and Cosmo godborn to rcost 12, Lesser reduced to rcost 9.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Godvoices lost 20 leadership (simply okleaders)
-- Swarmhive Princesses holy level degraded H2->H1, so the new Prowess of the Hive buff is inhibitively exhausting for them. Price remains 200g, so discount nerfed too.
-- Added travelling mage seduction events for Princesses within Luck dominion - seducing F2, W3, A2 and E2S2 mages 
-- (all are recruitable anyway, except hydromancers for MA). Luck 2 grants extra Necromancers. ALL EVENTS ARE COMMON.
-- --		MA Abolethive
-- Added Slave Generals and Slave Spearmen to landrec.
-- Marmecoleth Supplicants 55g -> 50g price (they're basically Theurg Communicants who don't die to single RoS)
-- Marmecodai and Lobomarmecs gained voidsanity (just to be safe)
-- Marmecodai are stealhy (like Godvoices); price 90g->100g.
-- Lobomarmecs -1 def, +2 MR (8->10)
-- Added global Oppression of Abolethive (anti-domkill global; keeps temple dominion at 4-10 points, and will boost Order and Prod if province has temple and Magic scales)
-- --		LA Swarmhive
-- Swarm Knights morale boost 13->14 (as brave as Godsworn infantry)
-- Nonsacred myrmec cavalry are magic beings; +2 MR, and ONSLAUGHT.
-- Myrmec cavalry enc 5->4 (fatigue-neutral E9 bless, enc 4 of heavy cavalry has precedent of Black Knights from Ulm, Cave Knights of Agartha, Serpent Cataphracts, Black Hunters and Zhayedans)
-- Changed Swarmhive Queens to S2N2?2 -> A1S2N2 + AESN (changed Earth to Air focus); this improves Air access but loses vital W/N and unimportant F/N.
-- (tip: use Protomarme Queens if truly desperate; they have 25% chance of N magic)
-- Added W magic for Renella Lament (so any hero but Prince can forge clams)
-- --		LA Abolethive (ADDED LA version)
-- Lobomarmec Troopers, decent stealthy mindless shielded light infantry to go with Marmec Troopers - have higher HP density so make good evo bait alongside Warriors.
-- Get an mindvesseled Marmecodai for utterly invulnerable raiding party (you can't Mindhunt mindless) and slap S1 booster to gateway them away if a lab is expected.
-- Marmec Heavy Troopers, res-heavy prot 21 mindblasters of heavy infantry quality (win most archery duels by default because can't get shot). 
-- Combine well with massed Warworkers assault who produce necessary resources anyway.
-- MARMECODAI Princes, S2 + WEDN2 H2, instead of Hive Aboleths. Have small retinue of 2 Warriors;
-- StR MARMECODAI Princesses S2 W1N1 + WESN1 H3. Have small retinue of 2 Warriors; Princesses are basically aboleth/polypal cross.
-- Grandmothers, W2S3N2H3+ 1.2 WESN immobile Marmec spawners. Can teleport, but will take severe landdamage.
-- Slave human troops 6028-6031, massable 9/9 crossbowmen, 9/9 spearmen and 9/22 heavy infantry. Generals are ldr 60 slave taskmasters for 40g, but you're better off building an Enslaver anyway.
-- Added final version of Abolethive (with diverse cap-only hybrid mages, Lobomarmec Troopers and slave humans, but no cheap Aboleths/amphibian Queens)
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --		MA (SIGNIFICANT REDESIGN)
-- Ironclads are now fort-recruit, but can't be recruited out-of-forts. The sole heavy infantry, and mildly overpriced to boot.
-- Non-Elder witches are fort-recruitable (so plain-based worlds don't leave the player scrambling for cap-only commanders
-- Reduced non-Brutannic Witches mainpath random to 10%
-- Discounted elders to 275->260g
-- Witch Valkyrie, Witch Queen and Longdead Witch spells are turned into transformation spells (requiring boosters or lucky X3 roll). 
-- Price down to 15 gems (given that the caster costs 260g anyway)
-- Valkyrie resistances was toned down to 8 pt all around and no poisonres at all; Queen gets H3 and Longdead Witch is immortal. 
-- --		LA (small but important changes)
-- Increased fort price penalty 25->50%, but lowered fortera 3->2 (so forts are 50g cheaper and built 1 month faster, at the price of lower defense and administration)
-- Removed darkvision from Snipers, but 12->13 prec.
-- Mistresses FWES-> FAWES randoms, price 210->245g (still valuable as seductresses and H2 dompushers)
-- All mounted mages have 3 misc items (being mounted is a price penalty anyhow)
-- +1 hp for Lords
-- Corrected Call Herald of Doom spell to summon one Herald, not plenty, and AOE damage fixed; 20 damage primary, 8 AoE.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- --		EA/MA
-- Storm Barbarians 35 -> 30g, they aren't as good as Stormsailors.
-- Renamed Storm Bowmen to Storm Archers
-- --		LA
-- Altar of Thunder and Titan are discounted by 20 points, as national pretenders.
-- Stormsworn Zealots are now archers and stay behind along with Stormsworn Bowmen instead of rushing and dying.
-- Stormchanters, Stormsworn Zealots and Ironstorm Elders gained Spectral Shields.
-- Stormsworn Captain gained Shocking Grasp.
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth
-- --		EA
-- Heavy infantry 10->11 att, 11->12 gcost; Guards 11->12 att.
-- Solar Heat uses Astral magic, not Air.
-- --		MA
-- Increased all infantry and Hyena/Hawk prices; by 1 for chaff and by 5 for reforming infantry.
-- Sand Slayers have fireres 8->15 since the EA version got sacred-ed and had 3->10.
-- --	--	Dassem
-- Devil Guards Pacts cannot be used by demons and the summons gain 10 points of horrormark so size 2-4 creatures are targeted less often during assassinations, although it screws with Call Horrors.
-- Size 5-6 don't get the horrormark on Devil Guards so no real changes.
-- --		EA
-- Czaatch as hero (E2B3 tough SC chassis demon. Maybe add more story?)
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum
-- Added Arcanian Probing, Legacy Probing and Necromagician Probing/Knowledge spells. 
-- Those are S3 caster/gem-free/S9, S3 caster/1 pearl/S9 and S2D2 caster/3 pearl or gem/S9D9 sitesearch spells.
-- Ether Doorway research level reduced 5->4 (still mageturn-intensive at S3D1; only EA can afford it)
-- --		EA
-- Arcanian Apprentices turned to solid 2-path unit, with S1 +AESD magic. Priced 120g, which is not pretty for 14 rp.
-- --		LA
-- Reduced the Returneds price to 30 gems (LA is gem-dry).
-- --	--	Tetrachires (racial nerf)
-- Reduced racial base prot 4 -> 3. Rock tribe and Quadro and others with base prot 5+ unaffected, though.
-- --		MA
-- Axefighters have hatchets replaced with axes; -0.5 att, -2 def, +4 total damage.
-- Reduced Adepts of the Dau to 35->25% random
-- Zax altered S3B3-> F1S3D1B2H1
-- --		LA (MAJOR CHANGES)
-- Reworked paths for Zax:
-- Shamans 200% FE + 35% FAWE -> 200% FE + 10% FAWE
-- Initiates [OLD B1+FSDB+0.25FAWE] -> B1 +FE, no unrest increase, price 105->70g
-- Adepts [OLD B1S1+ FSDB +0.35 FAWE -> F1E1B1H1 + FSDB], price ->210g, unrest +1, sacrificer/douse +1, reserarch +2
-- Masters [OLD B2S2 +1.35 FSDB +FAWE, research +7] -> F1E1S1B2H2 + FAWESDB +0.1 FSDB, unresst +2, sacrificer/douse +1, research +4
-- Champions F1E1H1 + 100 FE +35 FAWE-> 100 FE +50 FAWE
-- Added B1W1 Steal Blood spell (= Break the first soul)
-- Added B1E1 Unholy Power spell (grants aoe 5+ unholy power) and B5E2 Greater Unholy Power. No effect on mindless.
-- Hero Zax S4B4H3 -> F1S3D1B4H3.
-- Added hero Xyrgon, immortal B2 Tetradaemon Champion demonic hero. Boring one.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Militia-tier goblins are gcost 7->6, but no chaosrec; smallbow Raider Archers are 15g
-- Caves, forests and wastelands also enable Goblin Chief recruitment (manyspies!)
-- --		LA
-- Hobgoblin Commanders 50g->100g (was too cheap), and #spy like Goblin Chiefs.
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- --		EA
-- Starved Ones 4g->5g, furs -> leather cuirass.
-- Shaman of the Soil 120g->125g, researchbonus -1 -> -2.
-- Soil Guards are no longer capital-only; now nation has an *actually usable unit* outside of capital. Dual/triple/quadbless with utterly horrible scales is welcome.
-- Druids of the Soil gained second random and 280->350g price penalty; now E2, S2, and E1S1 ones are vital.
-- --		LA
-- Addupkeep -3 for Thirsty troops, and addupkeep -5 for Hungry fighters/flayers.
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- Barbarian slaves 9g->8g (too coward and Leather Cuirassed)
-- Drakonic Warriors 11g->10g (they didn't have anything going except pillage, survivals and racial +1 hp/str... so why not?)
-- All flyers gained mountain survival.
-- --		EA
-- Dragonkin Warriors 15g->14g (cheaper than later ages)
-- Added cap-only Winged Dragonkin (25g Green Dragonkin flyers with lances and bronze scale cuirasses). 
-- That's... one scary lineup addition, seriously.
-- EA Dragonborn have 100% main/secondary/tertiary randoms: 100% AE + 0.33 F/W -> 100% FAE/WAE, 100% WE + 0.33N -> WEN. 250g price retained.
-- --		MA
-- Sages fixedresearch 5 + 2; with magic = 9.
-- Prices of cap-only Jarls increased to 300g, for all of them.
-- --		LA Dragenheim
-- Dragenheres hp 15->16.
-- Bladragenjarls H3 -> H2 (now nation is average priest-wise)
-- Blue Vandragens younger 10 years.
-- --		LA Drakonia
-- Both Red/Green Sages +2 -> +0 researchbonus, primary randoms -> AWE; cost 190->165, -> no common N3/F3 out-of-cap
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- (Fel)Orc Raiders +1 att/def, -5 gcost (forgot mounted price penalty getting applied)
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- Renamed spearmen to impalers.
-- Downgraded Cavern Ku to bronze and made them fully amphibious, so they don't work too poorly as UW cave recruits. 
-- Sprites also updated so they are not different from both Iron and Bronze of MA/LA.
-- Lesser Blessing of Ak-Koyash is aoe l and is range 5, fatigue 50 (exhausting for A1, taxing for A2+).
-- Both Davyl servants are X3Y1->X2Y1 but still 10++ for 12 gems (2004 base)
-- Added F/A underwater-only sitesearching spell.
-- --		MA
-- Gained Coral Warriors as UW recruits, too; PD changed to 40 Spearmen.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Renamed militia to tribesmen.
-- Added Ironblades for MA/LA - short sword-wielding infantry; still abymsal because it's def 11 with shield *and* short sword on size 3, but takes Quickness okay-ish
-- --		MA
-- Added UW Stygian Elders recruitment - so the nation is land-based but favours UW expansion greatly.
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- -1 Cavemen morale, except Axesworn.
-- Base cavemen price down to 18g, MA/LA elites 23->24g and branded guard 26->28g
-- Swapped Greater Burial Pyre and Celestial Messengers - former are Conj 8->7 and the latter areConj 7->8
-- GBP and Celestial Messengers nreff 2000->1004 (less scaling but still noticeable)
-- --		EA
-- Many Charred-alike sacreds have fireres 15->10 and coldres 15->10.
-- --		LA
-- Ruthum Smiths 185g->200g (tough, ogre-ish Magma Erupters with chance for natural E3)
-- --	--	Hegude
-- --		EA
-- hegude wolf warriors 12->11g (since they're only using magic daggers but otherwise have no special stuff)
-- River Sages upgdraded researchbonus 2->4 (to fit the MA/LA versions without magic, and they're still horrible as combat mages)
-- River Sages tweaked the magical paths (now FAEN + AWED, very diverse magic with important crosspaths but only W2, and rare A2/E2 are combative. N2 are shamans only.
-- River Princes and Kings have FAEN primary random (acid bolts and acid rains).
-- FINALLY corrected Totem Spirit to summon totem spirit.
-- --		MA/LA
-- --	--	Ochrehulk
-- Renamed spearmen to impalers.
-- Slightly tweaked Corrosive Bites; sizes 1-3 don't drool on entire square and only rust equipment on damage (with their str it's common though).
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil
-- --		EA/LA
-- Craving Idols no longer generate straight unrest (but still eat people)
-- --		MA/LA
-- Increased all Soul xxx prices by 1: 13-15->14-16, except Soul Crossbows at 15g
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- Small bugfix for Ritual of the Seventh Tomb (aka Twiceborn national) to be enabled, Jotun Reanimation no longer scales (is still awesome replacement for regular Reanimation)
-- Frostfire Blizzard F4W3->F5W3 (it's actually *stronger* than Flame Storm, for same price and lower research (and causes hellish fatigue); thus requirements should be lower!)
-- --		LA
-- Marauder commanders research penalty 4->5 (absolutely worthless even at Magic scales)
-- Adepts and Masters lost diversity: D2?2 -> W1D2?1, F1W1D3?1 -> W1D3?1.
-- Increased Bane Sling ammo to 3 (better Assault Infantry and Seventhtombers).
-- --	--	TODO
-- OCHREKAN PRETENDERS UNIQUE SPRITES! They currently iirc use size 5 sprites of heroes/cap-only recruits.
-- Add more content for Arcania (87kb), Ruthum (mere 84kb), Ochrekan (pitiful 75 kb), and Vilium.
-- Idea for Ruthum: cave-only remote attack?
-- Remove all those extraneous unused comments for stuff no longer true.
-- Finish DiabloII nation conversions.
-- Finish MA Azeroth ambassador mechanic and sprites.
-- Look into Dassem assassin balance (swamps for LA need extra recruit, for example)
-- Investigate the wonders of Arcanian humans who have FW magic as primary paths. Possibly add EA precedessor nation?

-- Renamed Karakylyches to Karadavyls, added size 2 Servants (very slim on HP, badly want prot buffs, but are flyers who can swarm)
-- Added F3A3S3D2 Saladin unique Conj 8 summon
-- Karadavyl Court summons both Warriors and Servants, F3S1 spell requirements
-- Ak-almashtyru further price reduction -> 10 gems.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- REMOVE TEST ANCIENT BLACKWING BY 4.31
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Tweaked att/def scores of some minotaurs: Celestial bulls att/def 10->9 100g->95g, Immolartors +1 def,
-- Deviltaurs: no shockres and +2 att/def.
-- Correct taxboost
-- --		MA
-- Axesworn Smiths: -1 -> -3 research as everyone else
-- --		LA
-- Branded Guards: upgraded to Chain Hauberk
-- Bonekeepers: -1 -> -3 research penalty as everyone else
-- --	--	Hegude
-- Replaced EA hero with more generic A4S3H3 angel, since the nation got scrapped (magic too identical to MA/LA Hegude itself)
-- --	--	Ochrehulk
-- Added E2B3, E4F3N1H2 and F1A1E2 S3-4 heroes
-- Added W1E2N1 (40 MA, 20 LA) and F1W1E2 (20 MA, 40 LA) Primordial pretenders; very nice E9 (N9) chassis with awake expansion potential. Incredibly high natural prot, but very bad mapspeed..
-- Added Sand to Sand and Stone.
-- --		MA
-- Added Breath of Illwinter spell, causes Illwinter (despite the nation pointedly *not* having mass blood magic or being Jotun descendants)
-- Frostbounds cold 2->3
-- Frostbinder price reduced -10 basecost
-- Jadehulk price 50->55g
-- Ancient Jadehulks good->okleaders
-- --		LA
-- Ochrehulk Sage researchbonus 0->2
-- Newblood price 60->55g
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil
-- Fixed some stuff; now clean Transformations instead of dirty killcasters (pathboost +2X +2H for Idols, +1X +1H for Spirits)
-- As a result, X5H5 idols are quite commonplace (and LA Malevil is a terrifying domkill engine, just make an awake expander and
-- Dawn, Sky and Raven are scheduled to be transformed into unique summons for EA/MA/LA Malevil; LA Vilium won't have those.
-- Vilium hero designs: human soulsmith, human soulknight, golem mastersmith with idol items.
-- Malevil hero designs: nature/earth/astral druid (first soulsmith for EA), blood2 / FAN? 2 multihero (Child of Craving Idol), H1 Idol Champion multihero (non-homesick colossus with superhuman stats)
-- Malevil hero designs: beastial F2A2N2B4 late era mage, Forge Breaker
-- --		EA/LA
-- Changed starting army to 15 Hunters and Warriors (higher combat skills, no ranged troops)
-- --		LA
-- Crossbowmen scale cuirass -> leather hauberk (-2 prot, -4 rcost)
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- --		EA
-- Reduced Temple Warrior stats, only have sacred status against regular troops
-- --	--	TODO
-- Add Vilium thematic forest/mountain/etc summons, and generally diversify the boring humans with straight-up spirits (even if national F4/A4/N4/B4 mage chassis are dirt-cheap for 33 to 40 gems)
-- Possibly some minor changes weren't documented






-- --	--	Whatever adds here.
-- --***	VERSION 1.25
-- --		GENERAL
-- Some dumbing down LA mages, for Dragenheim/Drakonia in particular (they don't N4/F4/W4 mages anyway, and lack of A4 isn't much of a loss given that Longdead Dragons only require A3D3 and can be A4)
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- Hegude Knight of Hidden Light. Reintroduced sprites for small Sukarakoyash land mages.
-- Sukarakoyash: Ak-almashtyru, Ak-davyl, Kara-ak Staff.
-- Brutal Huns, Slytherin.
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive
-- Reduced Warworker hp 12->11
-- Spray Acid is no longer #nostr, damage 0
-- From 1.24 hotfixes: Marmec King -> dom3 S2N1, added W2 Primordial Marmec trampling earth snake equivalent.
-- Replaced Pincer Latch of Primordial and Gargantuan with Corrosive Bite.
-- Added Mutinuos events.
-- Reduced Protomarmec Princess/queen research scores (so it isn't better than revenant)
-- Some MR fixes. 
-- Rise of Swarmhive creates Controllers as well as Brigadeers; small troops don't spawn unless 100 gold available in treasury
-- Riches from beneath fort income boost for all five nations.
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --		EA
-- Added Huns horse archers as hero-dependent recruits; Atila himself is a F2A2H1 mage with retinue and domsummon. Huns eat gold aplenty with 25/35/45 price progression, but are not particulary resource-intensive.
-- --		MA
-- Added more events for MA heroines.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- --		LA
-- Ironstorm Elders A3W2 -> A3W1, worsened Water magic. They still remain the most powerful Air mages of the age, with A3 magic nobody else retained.
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth
-- --	--	Dassem
-- Renamed Officers to mercenary captains. Increased MR to 12.
-- Added Hassan-ibn-sabbah multihero B2H2 with 4 bloodblade initiate bodyguards and freespawn.
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum
-- --	--	Tetrachires
-- Reduced Smith of the Dau MR 14->13, Adept of the Zax 15->14. 
-- Initiates of the Zax don't require temple, Zax only has H3 magic.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Goblin Chiefs gained 20 command score, so that you needn't use second commander in EA to expand.
-- Pyrg Master MR 16->17
-- Empowered Goblin Brewery/alchemy to Fire gem levels.
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Swapped around IDs so that Harvesters transform correctly.
-- Slashers +1 att, -1 ambidextrous (technically nothning comes of it), except LA who only lost ambidextrity.
-- LA mage-priests +1 MR each.
-- Vampire Stalkers received dousing bonus (so they can compete with Vampire Counts for same 44 slave price, despite 300g-equivalent upkeep)
-- Tweaked Wither World, 3% chance per province and requires 5- dominion, but increased #req_permonth limit, removing it entirely for non-D1B1 ones. LA get holy vampires to boot.
-- Also, necromaner host and hungry wolves events happen more often.
-- --	--	Drakonia/Dragenheim
-- Added MA/LA N4S2W2E1H2 dragonkin healer hero.
-- Tweaked some MR values, so that Vandragen and dragonkin mages and LA zealots have proper MR.
-- Corrected Send XX Dragon so they don't show up as Monster Boar-users national spells.
-- --		LA
-- Vandragendrotts and Green Wingborn cut down in magical paths. 
-- No more supercharged Nature and Air magic (the only nation to retain non-heroic A4 is Electrum)
-- Removed stealth from LA Vandragen commanders; now only sailing.
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- Reduced Gul'dan's morale.
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash (ONCE MORE OVERHAUL! May have mistakes and inconsistencies!)
-- National paths: SEVERELY CUT DOWN ON WATER. Now only W1 on Wave Spellcasters, Sikherche-beks, and W2 late summon and hero; Air magic is more prominent. As a result Enzhe Shaula are necessary for Clams.
-- MA gem income F2N2 W1->A1, of course. MA fort PD are all Bronze Impalers.
-- Desert Ku Spellcasters have FA 100% S 50% magic, unlike two other breeds. This represents national FA paths.
-- 
-- Karakylych Viziers F2S2D1 -> F2A2D1; now they can Cloud Trapeze without Starshin skullcap. Loss of S2D1 crosspath hurts of course.
-- Moved all curses to thaumaturgy, since they're exactly that - curses. Thaumaturgy deals with curses, evocations are mostly DD spells without MR component.
-- Black Reavers 5+ -> 6++, they are way too frail for a high-end summon that's difficult to get. Demonic nature makes them simply not good.
-- Karrashaitan price 9->8 slaves for a single summon, 30->32 for a mage.
-- Enzhe Shaula makepearls 1->3, so that there's a lot of pearls. 
-- Large Eske Shaula are purely combat-dedicated (skullcap+jar+bottle+amulet of the fish or whatever; they're pretty good casters).
-- Added Ak-davyl vizier/servants summons for MA/LA; land only A3F1D1 equivalent of Karakylcyh, no native armor but ethereal and has fist/fist/Lightning Swarm attack. 
-- Ak-davyl are coldblooded and vulnerable to frost; servants are Sylph equivalents.
-- Added Ak-almashtyru, A1H1 spy-assassins; very nice 160g/14gem fellows. Tolerable A2S1 requirement; EA needs a few Mystics for N2/A2/F4/S5 anyway.
-- Added Air magic thamaturgy of Ak-sikherche, aoe 1 A1, aoe 10 A3+1gem and battle-wide A5+2gem Mistform spell. *Only works on land though* - underwater glamour/darkness are Alterations
-- Added Karak-ak staff, a F4A4 staff of elemental mastery equivalent; grants airwaterbreathing and 50% darkvision, but doesn't boost ritual ranges.
-- Altered Dim Trident and Irekle helmet paths to F1A1 and F3S1.
--
-- Olug-shah hero F3W2D1N2 -> F2A3D1N2, gained stormpower and stormimmunity and high shockres.
-- Hero Shadowshifter now has AOE 1 shadow shift missile attack. Killing vampires and other interesting lords? Never easier.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Upgraded land troops equipment: scale mail cuirass -> ring mail hauberk (-1 rcost and not iron, so better UW), scale hauberk -> chain hauberk (way tougher), +1 Ironspear/mace/elite morale.
-- All sacreds fixed at 60g. Drywings only have prot 5 like all other Kryluds.
-- Added EA/MA/LA hero Izummnu-kin the Son of Prophecy W2S2N1H3. A very powerful mix of beefed up warlord, H3 sailor and Prophecy seer; present in all ages granting S2 access.
-- Added MA/LA hero Kannibalos the Spineless Blackwing, F2D1B2 non-sailing bloodbreaker. Enables breaking into Vampire Lords with a D3 commander, or with D2 empowerment can take care of it himself.
-- Strength of Blackwings D2W1->D1W1.
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Riches from Beneath income bonus
-- --	--	Hegude (new sprites)
-- --		MA
-- Paladins are W1->W2 base, 10 years youngers; cap income F2A1W2-> F1A1W2D1
-- Added Knights of Hidden Light D1H2 cap-only stealthy heretical inquisitors. Don't have numbing light, but all the same good thugs.
-- Guidance of Light doesn't grant bluntres; only pure +prec.
-- Added MA thaum 6 D1H2 and LA evo 8 F3H3 anti-undead polymorphing spells; tailored to eradicated Vampires and Liches and whatever; 
-- both have long enough range to snipe back rows if placed close to centre (which the national melee troops focus presupposes anyway).
-- --	--	Ochrehulk
-- --		LA
-- Ancient Ochrehulks E3F1W1 -> E3 + FWEN2, like Atlantis Kings of the deep.
-- Old frostbound MR score fixed 12->17. Goldsmith MR 14->15.
-- Corrected Crystal Giant sprite
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil
-- --		EA
-- Idol-bound warriors gcost 16->15, corrected PD
-- --		LA
-- Broken idol-bound 10g->9g (because they don't even have flagellants' flails)
-- Hammermen +1 hp (like swordmen)
-- --	--	Icedgarth
-- Added the nation. A few changes compared to 1.01; most notably bugfixes.
-- --	--	TODO
-- Sprites for MA Azeroth. Tidy up the troops selection.
-- Sprites for MA Baal. Those demons should be cute.
-- Sprites for EA Shiar'rin; meditate on lore some more.
-- Sprites for still-unnamed nation entwined with Hegude, inhabited by semi-divine beings. Find a lore-complaint reason for their FAW + S magic. MAKE THEM DIFFERENT TO HEGUDE.


-- --	--	Whatever adds here.
-- --***	VERSION 1.24
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- Banners of Northern and Raging winds.
-- Loads of Tetrachires items. Heroine and a hero.
-- Loads of EA Hegude stuff.
-- Some Brutannic stuff
-- A few Robbledoth items, all grant blessing.
-- Not done LA abolethive sprites.
-- Sukarakoyash Shaulas (FWSN magic crosspath, most valuable for LA to produce Clams)
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Many IDs rearranged, now all pretenders and heroes hhave fixed IDs.
-- Started adding unique events for heroes. At the moment, mostly Swarmhive and Brutannia are covered.
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive (significant)
-- Fixed siegebonus for some abolethive commanders and some other minor stat fixes.
-- Protomarmec Skinsuit is equivalent to Shambler Skin Armor.
-- Added pretenders, added Primordial Marmec pretender (W2 trampling erf snek equivalent, with less hp, but mobile and with OK slots)
-- --		EA/MA
-- Increased Aero Godborn defense 13->15.
-- Eerie H4->H3, she isn't influential. Added events which empower her and Nameless.
-- splite Create Godborn to five different spells, Lesser Godborn are N1H3 and cost cheaper than others at 24++/8gems vs 21+/10. 
-- Gem cost of the spell is negligible, cause they eat GOLD. A LOT of it, over 15 extra each while they're being trained.
-- Reduced Gargantuan Myrmec Conj 5->4.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Reduced humans' precision by 2 on average (think Agarthans).
-- --		Abolethive
-- Reduced Gharoide price 20->15 gems (given freespawn they're more harmful than helpful)
-- Reduced popkill for mature Gharoides 2->1, same as small ones.
-- LA Abolethive: improved Marmecoleth Princes and increased price, added aquatic W1S2N1H3 Princesses and W2S3N3H3 Grandmothers
-- LA abolethive has cap-only commanders as well, they're not StR as much.
-- --	--	Brutannia (significant)
-- Extended Brutannic pretender lineups, adding Great Black Bull in particular, Annunaki of Love and War, Criosphinx, Thrice Horned Boar; removed Avatar of Doom from EA.
-- Titan of Violence built-in AOE attack 12->20 damage
-- Gifted Ones gained slowrec and price increase, since there's now a site recruiting them and they're pretty powerful.
-- --		EA
-- More buffs.
-- Removed mastersmith and masterrit penalties from both Brutal Warsmiths and Disciples and whatever (since Disciples only have F1 anyway)
-- Improved Warmsith research to 7 points with 2 point penalty, but they aren't drainimmune like Witches and thus are only 2rp/turn at D3.
-- Removed all chaosrec, Brutal Warmith research improved -4 -> -2 penalty.
-- Increased Demon Knight of Brutus: mr 16->17, pillagebonus 15->25, no mastersmith penalty, freespawn 1 Spirit of Violence in combat
-- Improved Monument of War: hp 200->300, prot 25->30, incunrest 15->10 (it was really crippling for a 160point slab of rock, making this cheap Soul Contract chassis obsolete)
-- HERO ADDED: Weyland the Legendary Warsmith (or should it be Wayland?..). F1A1E2B2H3 mastersmith 1 forgebonus 2 who can fly. 
-- (There's also Agaros hero stranded somewhere nearby, but he hasn't made it to a civilized land. Got assassinated by Demonbreds, you see? He's likely to go into Icedgarth)
-- Rebalanced spells again; devil 15->14 slaves, send dozen 44->40, Send Warhost level 8->7 and only at Hall. Added 100 slaves/cast Brutal Demon/Imp summoning spell (like Infernal Forces but 2 levels early)
-- --		LA
-- Added combat spell Call Herald of Doom, damages troops and summons one small herald for 3 blood slaves. It's not as expensive as real summon, since the caster is basically knocked out and a serious army will deal with it anyway.
-- Reduced Empower Champion price 35 -> 30 pearls.
-- Kaempedo deserting chance reduced.
-- Heroic Events added.
-- --	--	Electrum (minor)
-- Added item: Banner of Raging Storms, A3E1 const 4, tmpairgems 1 (just think of all those upkeep-free Storms, Arrow Fends, Wrathful Skies, and whatever), autospell Orb Lightning
-- and shockres/stormimmune combo (pick your lovely Tartarian, or a Faerie queen, or whatever, and make it carry the banner... um, though your commanders are likely better unless it's LA)
-- --		LA
-- Ironstorm Elders fixed at A3W2.
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth (minor)
-- --		EA
-- Improved Solar Fire spell, +4 prec and 20->15 fatigue. Still isn't the best way to make your Priests work, onlu worth using on tough undead/demons with high MR.
-- Summon sandstorm A2E1 -> A3E1, was just too abusable.
-- --	--	Dassem (minor)
-- --		LA
-- Dassem Officers: nearly always have magical skills, but require no laboratory. Pay 10g premium for this... and you'd probably want to stuff any fort with mage assassins anyway.
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum
-- Corrected ether surge unrest increase.
-- --	--	Tetrachires (minor)
-- Added loads of national items: four for tribes, one for Zax and Dau, and one gemgen for Megachires. 
-- Masks for Rock assassins and Zax +H1 tainted, Ice aegis with Freezing touch, Obsidian blade with fire/coldres and berserk, staffs of wind with airshield stormimmune, and dau brand-like staff.
-- Also heart of elements, equivalent for Heart of life.
-- Call Megachires 55->50 gems. You'd need a Mother Oak to massively pull it off anyhow, and despite X4 a Megachires is way too expensive compared to Faerie Courts, only bringing in H3 and N2.
-- --		EA
-- Increased EA shamans costs by 10, since they turned out to be pretty effective.
-- Fire tetrachires are undisciplined, they are berserkers anyway.
-- Added F4N1 hero-warrior. Called him Arkesilaos. Added him Arkesilaos history. Funnily enough, it added to story.
-- --		MA
-- Added Priestess of Muses heroine. Has S magic too, and better than EA heroines.
-- --		LA
-- Reduced LA mage-priests MR by 1, since nation has weak-ish MR.
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Increased Psycho fire and Alchemical bomb damage to 9->10. Siegebonus on Psycho and Flame Warriors set to 4->5.
-- Werepyrgs gained second claw, but it's merely Golden (still hurts as a size 2 berserking werewolf should do).
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Added several bless items - staff, cuirass, helmet and chalice.
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- Dragon heart bearers don't transform in the presence of identical dragons.
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- FINALLY WRITTEN GODREBIRTH INTO SUMMARY.
-- Power of the Sukarakoyash is a Water power equivalent, national fire mages are INFINITELY BETTER UNDERWATER. Srsly.
-- Redesigned hydromancer/pyromancer lineup to Kara/Ak Sikherche, now UW use fire magic and overlands use Air magic; no special coastal recruits. Water magic is reduced.
-- Added several MRneg national fire evocations underwater, and a F1 Burning Heart equivalent at Alt 4 with MR negates.
-- Improved Karakylych Viziers - F2S2D1 magic, but NO randoms of AWEN or whatever; breaks into D and Skulls of Fire, and provides research. Also, amphibian sailor.
-- Increased Karakylych prices 15->20, because those flying magicweaponed dual-attacking summons are so much better than a worthless Troll, oneshotkillable or not.
-- (Like other Troll Kings, chaff is stil better served by a F6 mage spamming Contact).
-- Added Enzhe and Iske Shaulas, FWSN rainbow aquatic summons with very bad research.
-- --		EA
-- Irekle Heralds are 325->330g, but 50->100% random.
-- Kol Heralds are coastal recruit
-- --
-- --		LA
-- Lowered Karashaitan mage requirements B3S3->B2S3
-- Heralds are coastal recruits.
-- Heralds of the veil 200g ->230g.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- --		LA
-- Removed Oathsworn 10% random.
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Made Grand Immolators 10 years younger.
-- Reduced H4 hero to H3.
-- --	--	Hegude
-- River Companions are rec-everywhere in EA, but require a River King present; in MA/LA they're cap-only and thus largely irrelevant with all that sacred Templar buisness. MR reduced to 10 too.
-- Added Banner of the Northern Winds, casts breath of winter but A2W1 and enables gem-free army with all relevant Prayers.
-- Reduced leadership for Altair and Guowang Heguang.
-- --		EA
-- Added magical Wolfang daggers to naional Wolf tribe, and added Spirit warriors/shamans who use them as well. Increased gcost 11->12 because of this, though.
-- Added Pact of the Wolf, of the Bear and of the Deer; in forest, summons Dire Wolves, Great Bears or White Deers correspndingly (the latter are barely better than wolves, albeit animalawe can help)
-- Added immortal spirits of the Bear, the Wolf and the Deer, summonable to EA only; cost measly 20 gems for a pretty, thuggable stealthy chassis with N2W1 A/E/D1.
-- --		MA
-- Improved Angels of Death sailing; MUST add some Fomorian references, really!
-- Added send Angel of death spell, which - unsurprisingly perhaps - sends and Angel of Death.
-- --		LA
-- Added holyfire on capital site, which wasn't present for some reason.
-- Added FAW magic for Angels of Cleansing light.
-- Divine Cleansing: Avengers of Cleansing Light are Angels with built-in B9, Holy brand and Bottle of Living water.
-- Added a load of events for Divine Cleansing that cause severe gemloss of slaves and Death gems within dominion (2d6 from each province affected with 50% chance).
-- Oh, and a few events which cause serious raid of Hegude troops to pop up; I mean really, Champion, two major Priests and four small ones?
-- All in all, it's MORE than annoying.
-- --	--	Ochrehulk
-- Frost/glacierhulks are noleaders, but better magic leaders
-- Added Crystal Giant ench 7 summon, a 35 earth-gem Golem with way better stats and earth magic.
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil
-- Added soulforged armor pieces; just const 2 light armor with +2 mr, crystal matrix black plate armor with +3 mr, and const 6 elemental plate mail with +4 mr. All nice armor pieces.
-- --	--	TODO
-- Vilium/Malevil - add more stuff?.. Some kind of national equipment, not just fuelling the forges.
-- Add Tetrachires heroes, not multiheroes nation has now (a not-Zax sorcerer for MA would be nice, as well as LA necromancer; unique MA Tetrachires Priestess might be useful)
-- Add Robbledoth national item.
-- Make Icedgarthian sprites, since the nation is quite complete and original enough. Maybe add items first?..


-- --	--	Hero list (separate file?
-- --	--	Swarmhive/Abolethive (MA needs more, LA needs more)
-- EA - 2 heroes and 1 multihero
-- MA - 3 heroes and 1 multihero / 2 heroes and 1 multihero
-- LA - 1 hero and 1 multihero
-- Added Eerie, freespawn, lots of key cross paths, but totally immobile and not researching despite lots of paths so no turn arrival limit.
-- Add some human alchemist hero for LA. Because the current heroes aren't really fitting the human theme.
-- Plans: Add W3S3D3 Aboleth necromancer hero, so there's no need to make Abodai multiheroes. Add other Abolethive hero maybe.
-- --	--	Brutannia (EA BADLY needs more, MA and LA might use one)
-- EA - 2 hero and 1 multihero
-- MA - 3 heroines
-- LA - 3 heroes, one of them is multihero because of his peculiar mechanics
-- Added Atilla the Hun, now EA Brutannia has option of dirt-cheap sacred cavalry (30g for a sacred unit? that.
-- Find some really brutal hero from history or otherwise. Conan doesn't count, he's good and better off as MA hero. Maybe.
-- Add MA fire magic multihero, Descendant of Brutus (with F3 and freespawned Brutusians). Or don't. Added Fire Lord event instead.
-- Plans: Add some EA heroes and a MA hero. For EA, Atilla might have had worked... will consider this! He'll have to be spawning mounted archers of T'ien Ch'i-like type, but with sacred status.
-- --	--	Electrum

-- EA - 1 hero, ...Um, devils?
-- MA - 3 heroes, survivor of Zel?
-- LA - 3 heroes, maybe a Heldragenir?

-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum - might use different heroes for MA/LA.
-- EA - 3 heroes
-- MA/LA - 2 heroes
-- Lowered Gothmorg air magic access, since A3 is quite enough with RoS/RoW access.

-- EA - 2 heroes and 2 multiheroes
-- MA - 2 heroes and 1 multihero (who doubles as summon)

-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- EA - 2 heroes and 2 multiheroes

-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- EA - 3 heroes
-- MA - 2 heroes
-- LA - 2 heroes
-- Plans: Add a Son of Telkhines A2W2D2 multihero? It's a problem because only EA will be eligible. Add some other heroes for MA/LA?
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- EA - 2 heroes; might want to turn Dragen into national F4/W4/N4 unique summon, since he's frankly telkhine.
-- MA - 4 heroes
-- LA - 1 Drakonia, and 2 Dragenheim heroes
-- Plans: Add a MA/LA Drakonia green healer, to rally the Red and Green dragonkin
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- 4 heroes, quite enough
-- Plans: give 'em sprites eventually
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash - NO SPACE ANYWAY.
-- EA - 3 heroes
-- MA - 2 heroes
-- LA - 3 heroes, NO SPACE.
-- Plans: NO SPACE, I stress the fact. Either reducing the recruits'/PD diversity or forget the heroes.
-- --	--	Krylud, BADLY need more heroes and summon diversity
-- EA - 2 heroes (Fifth Blackwing, Isummnu-kin) and 1 multihero
-- MA, LA - 3 heroes and 1 multihero
-- Plans: maybe add a EA hero? Or make S version of Isummnu EA-only?
-- --	--	Ruthum - could use more non-magicking heroes; like asterios.
-- EA - 3 heroes
-- MA - 4 heroes, what a crowd!
-- LA - 2 heroes
-- Plans: add cavemen heroes. Because the Brightblaze isn't.
-- --	--	Hegude - needs more non-magicking heroes.
-- EA - 2 heroes, one needs replacement or rewriting
-- MA - 2 heroes and 1 multihero
-- LA - 2 heroes and 1 multihero

-- MA - 1 hero
-- Plans: add *normal* heroes.
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil - BADLY BADLY needs heroes.

-- EA - 2 heroes and 1 multihero
-- MA - 3 heroes
-- LA - 2 heroes
-- Plans: add a LA hero or multihero, so that Raum and Crocell don't feel lonely anymore.

-- Ochrekan, Vilium, Abolethive, LA Swamhive, LA Tetrachires heroes, and EA Dassem heroes.

-- Reduced rcost of Myrmec/Marmec Soldiers 27/32 base ->25/22 base, resulting 25/30 Swarmhive 25/27 Abolethive.
-- Gargantuan Myrmecs have E2 magic
-- Removed erratically available Great Sorceress
-- Cheapgod Neter of Kings (what use is his FWS anyway? SoEM and Rings aren't worth pretty shitty bless, F4W4S5 being the cheapest, and using RoS isn't really good way to empower)
-- Added S6 Ench 8 Grand stampede of the Hive. Same as Stampede but battlefield-wide.
-- Added N2H3 Create Godborn - a humanshape Queen spawns swarm of 20 Godborn, who then proceed to deprive you of any income... those literally bastards :P .
-- Hive Crystal is available for all four Swarmhive nations (=gem-free Onslaughts and Grand Stampedes with communions).
-- Reduced Heart of Swarmhive level to 4/4, added Grand Stampede as secondary spell effect.

-- Added second Underground Gateway spell at thaum 4, which is actually Gateway; the Underground Travel is thaum 6 and E3S3,

-- --		EA
-- Marmec Queens randoms ESN + 1.2WEN-> 2 WEN + 0.2 WES, trading S for W and N
-- --		MA
-- Slothresearch: reduced to 1, penalty reduced to 1 (so instead of +4/-8 swing, now there's more tolerable +2/-4 swing)
-- Fixed Princesses at A1S1N2 magical paths, thugging is worse, A2 is common; now cost 200g and retain 20% of extra AESN magic.
-- Changed Godborn into magic beings (again)
-- --	--	Abolethive (MAJOR)
-- Renamed naton from R'lyehive
-- ABOLETHS ARE CAP-ONLY, but not StR. 110% of WESD magic, no Air. So out-of-cap is... S2 WEDN1 magic access. VERY bad, but it's winnable. And rcost, castledef, supply etc. as proper.
-- Corrected Marmec Mother magic being leadership in landshape
-- Marmec Mothers un-queeny S2H3 ?3.1 paths -> W1S2N1H3 + WES + 1.2 WEN, price down to 395g too.
-- Lobomarmecs 3->12 resources
-- No research penalty on Marmec Enslavers (-1 -> 0, same 85g)
-- Added Marmec masterminds, S2 researchbonus 2 200g/75r old mage with 8 freespawn units, underwater/coastal.
-- Added load of freespawn for Aboleths and Hive Lords, same as Masterminds
-- Reduced Marmecodai price 130g -> 115, since they're only useful for diversity and banishments (Divine Blessing doesn't rate).
-- Marmecoleth Supplicants are mindless (immune to Astral Tempest, and the communion slaves are likely to die when routed anyway)
-- Reduced Marmec Trooper rcost 31 -> 28
-- Gharoides research Conj 6->5
-- Increased Marmecoleth Troopers att/def scores to 12, cost reduced to 45g - normal unarmed Marmecoleths cost 35g, since fighting isn't really job of those units and they aren't quite good enough.
-- Mind Lords upgraded to A1W3S3 + WESD +0.3 SDN +0.2 AWE, chance of S5 (with vesseled N1 Marmecodai you can transform and build RoS/RoW), but cost 420->450g (they are *even more overpriced* than EA ones)
-- PD commander 2 is Mastermind, extra freespawn at def 20 forts.
-- added four cursed aboleth-only items, W1 bubble, N1S1 leadership booster, E2N1 +2E earth-boosting moss that grants -1S and D2S2 diseasing +2D death gem booster
-- Raise Abodai D1S3 -> D3S2, requires a boosted caster or forged Necrotic Leech (with a D2S2 requirements, so again booster)
-- Added Turkuul and Eeerie heroes, A3W3S4 sailor and W1 E2 S5 N2 H4 insane ring forger.
-- --	--	Brutannia (major changes for EA Brutannia)
-- Added Brutal strike, magical armor-breaking kick/punch/whatever as extra attack for Initiates, Disciples, Demon Knights, Spirits of Violence and Spirits of War
-- Replaced Brital Flames with Fire Flare 350, it's largely identical anyway
-- Significantly altered Spirits of War, adding Fear and natural protection of 4/6/8; invulnerability scores are 20/25/30. Pillagebonus 15->50.
-- Chaospower goes down for larger spirits, who get pure stats instead (att 9->15, ap 12->18, str 12->22 unchanged)
-- The larger Spirits of War also don't die, but instead keep shrinking, granting them a few extra lives as they return to their size 6 glory after battle.
-- Added Spirits of Violence, small ethereal dogs with Brutal Strike. All Spirits of War freespawn 1d6 Spirits of Violence. Titan got some too, price kept same
-- Added Demon Knights of Brutus, Blood 6 B2E2 summonable size 4 commanders; can't cast Brutal power with F1E2B1 but have E buffs. Also, 35 hp thick.
-- Mordred stats altered to resemble Demon Knight of Brutus.
-- Once again swapped Brutal Power and Brutal Fire, so F1H1 don't do stupid suicide rushes.
-- Increased okundead leadership for Champions and Disciples, so they can haul lots of demons around.
-- Initiates have +1 holyboost, so experienced Chieftains are effectively identical to them, but non-cap Disciples don't get H3 and only Champions achieve it.
-- Cut down prices once again (Disciples 300->250 in particular to account for their armor nerf etc), so that Disciples don't eat somuch gold
-- All Champions of Brutus are upkeep-free but cause low incunrest (0,5).
-- Increased chaosrec on troops up to 1/2/3.
-- Removed chaosrec from Brutal Chieftains (as they are, once again, become initiates with experience)
-- Brutal Warlocks are guaranteed F1B1H1, with -2 research and 80g price.
-- Reduced Witches prices to 35g, since they don't have anything better to do but sit tight and reearch slowly.
-- Brand of Brutus costs F3B7, and requires preaching to get stuff transformed... so transforming Mound Fiends is out of question, need Flying boots for them.
-- Added spells: Bind Spirits of Violence, E2B2 Bind Demon Knight of Brutus, Send Brutal Dozen (Horde from Hell, brutal version), Bind Greater Spirit of War, and Send Warhost.
-- Doomsworn Champions gained fear and +1 att/def, incunrest 1.0->3.0; still 35 pearls. They are 50% more expensive than a GoRed, Danava, but are scary thugs.
-- --		MA
-- Minor stat fixes for Witch Queen.
-- Heroines lost 1 mpath, by scheme X4 Y2->Y1 +(two WES) 2

-- Added Hernan Cortes, A2W2H2 sailor and Demon Cleansing buffer.
-- Guardians 28g -> 26g, same as Wardens who are sacred.
-- Mageknights size 3.
-- Conqueror enc 5->4.
-- Heralds of Doom gained similiar 4/6/8 20/25/30 prot/invulnerability scores, noticeably reducing longevity of average Heralds (prot 20 is worse than prot 25).
-- Larger Heralds of Doom lose xpowers and gain stats, size 4 have chaos+magicpower and size 6 only magicpower, ap 12->18 att 10->16 (marginally better than Spirits of War).
-- Incidentally, smallest size 2 ones have also lost a lot of their base atk score (-5) as a result.  Should no longer be as armykilling without rigor mortis backing them up.
-- Although it should be noted that immortality severly improves their usefulness compared to very much mortal Spirits of war who cost the same.

-- Rise of Swarmhive NS -> SN crosspath, Ench 7->6.

-- --		EA/MA
-- Added Gargantuan Myrmec summon, size 5 trampler with enc 2 and very good prot; triple corrosive spit.
-- --		MA
-- Godsworn price 14g->15g; they're still fairly weak since they wear light armor and have mediocre stats.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Swarm Wizards fixed from E1S1?1 -> E1S1N1 magic, no out-of-cap FAW access unless underwater
-- --		LA
-- Godsworn Knights are now magical beings and subject to ONSLAUGHT. ...Oops? (A stack of Godsworn Knights can be uberbuffed!)

-- Brutal Warlocks require a temple and fort now.
-- Spirits of war reinvigoration 10->5

-- --		MA
-- Brutannic Warsmiths magic 50% ->20%, stealthy
-- Elders: pricing increased further and -1 hp, but StR not returned and not stealthy (a bunch of Wind Circlers can sail, though).
-- --		LA
-- High Lord: 50% ->100% random, associated price hit. Very strong thugs - they can dual-expand with N9 against most provinces.
-- Gifted Ones from Bestower of Gifts: short sword + ring mail cuirass + iron cap as equipment, Theft of Life and dmg 10 lifedrain.
-- Gifted Ones: transformation at 50 xp, so most often ther chassis is ranged Theft of Life casters. Increased relevant stats by 1 compared to indies.
-- Doomsworn Champion: actually amphibians

-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth (NONE)
-- --	--	Dassem (MINOR)
-- Removed undead immunity from bloodblades (dt_drain causes it anyway)
-- Reduced Devil Guard Pact price to 15/5 (~25 slaves for 2 permanent Devil Guards; Infernal Guard provides them for <4 slaves each) - it requires blood-boosting S1 mage, so not easily massable, and the carrier needs extra protection to shrug off evocations (s)he's likely to be catching.
-- --		EA
-- Removed blood bonus from cap-only site, income 7 slaves-> 1 fire 1 earth 5 blood.
-- --		LA
-- Dassem Officer 125g -> 150g (they're good infantry-carrying sailors)
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum (NONE)
-- --	--	Tetrachires (MAJOR)
-- Removed all leadership penalties (25/50 -> 40/80; not that 40g Tetrachires are really massable anyway, but indies are valuable with such expensive troops)
-- (Consider *another* global price increase of +5 (totalling at 45), since they're so ....ing unstoppable?...)
-- Changed basic ENC to 5 for most Tetrachires. It compensates for their incredible damage output - and Cold 3 doesn't really hurt since they get fatigued out anyhow.
-- Megachires rock enc 3->2, ice/fire 4->3; Fire hp 99->96, Wind prec 13->14.
-- Somewhat rearranged pretender choices, added and removed a few from EA (more N and some D), removed D and added S for MA, LA mostly unchanged.
-- Lowered PD and starting army (since 40g troops are horrifying)
-- --		EA
-- Coldres 5 for everyone non-Outcast. +1 prec for Wind. Some troop renaming.
-- Outcasts and Adepts (wasterec): basecost 40->50g, mor 11->10 (truly coward), no reclimit (rcost is high enough).
-- Quadro Kin 75g -> 80g (they've got lower stats than Monks, but superior equipment as long as no ethereal/invulnerability/mistform is involved)
-- --		MA
-- The mage-derived prophets are H5, all priest-based ones are H4 (and multiheroes are H3).
-- Adepts of the Dau noleader-> poorleader.
-- Monks stats slightly increased (+2hp +1 str +1 def), xpshape of Hand reduced to 100, fists -> stone fists (+2 dmg), but price increased too 60->80g.
-- Added Protection of the Dau H3 buffing spell, affects 5+ sacred troop squares with Temper Flesh equivalent. Must-cast for all Megachires buffing cycles.
-- --		MA/LA
-- Pillagebonus 2 for Breakers, so they don't suck compared to Barbarians as much (they still are twice as expensive,and frankly the only useful way to pillage is sailing)
-- Axemen have 1 less throwing axe, and Javelinists carry extra dagger (better melee). Lost def bonus of +2 since it's unjustified.
-- Defenders now cost 50g and have better att/def, but lost morale advantage and enc advantage. Still fairly good compared to rest of lineup, since they don't die to chaff.
-- --		LA
-- Enslavers priced at 35g, they're worse than other regular Tetrachires stat-wise, but net and poison claw have their uses.
-- Removed Douse from Adepts and Initiates of the Zax. Increased Masters price to 350g, douse reduced to 1. Taskmaster increased 2->3.
-- Slaves stats further degenerated (8/8/10/8 att/def/prec/mor ->7/7/8/7, 50% affliction chance), armor -> lthr cuirass, price of 22g unchanged though
-- Added Blood 8 Tetradevil unique summon, F4E3B4 with good slots from B6S6 summoner (likely Zax); can function as SuperCombatant or SpellCaster
-- Tetrademons gained -4 research penalty, and enc 4->3 (they're supernatural, duh).
-- --	--	Pyrgdor (MINOR)
-- Pyrghost Pack is 21->50 slaves, Blood 6->7 spell and provides 3+->7+ Pyrghosts.
-- Dart of Chaos and Rain of Chaos spells corrected, both don't affect lifeless and undead troops.
-- --		LA
-- Increased Spirit warrior cold resistance to 10. Now 10-resistant to 3 elements. Grinch had his resistances altered too.
-- --	--	Robbledoth (MINOR)
-- Changed Blood Thirst, it's now mrnegates like Blood Hunger.
-- Bine Ghouls is D1 and summons way more ghouls, 13+++ for 5 gems.
-- --		MA
-- Harvester Priest/Elder researchbonus -4 -> -3
-- --	--	Drakonia/ Dragenheim (MAJOR for LA Dragenheim, NONE for others)

-- Dragenbein Crafters mountain survival (they're barbarians still)
-- REMOVED foreignrec (since it didn't really make sense)
-- --	--	MA Horde (MINOR)

-- --	--	Sukarakoyash (MINOR)
-- Low-tier 6g ->7g price, 7g->8g, correct rcost for all Spirit Helmet wearers
-- All four kinds of Warriors have +1 att/def scores (upkeep is over 2x, so all stats should be better to justify paying it).

-- --		MA
-- Corrected Dim resource costs, increased DIm Warrior price to 30g.
-- --	--	Krylud (MAJOR)

-- Archers fist -> claw (reptiles they are)
-- Warlords +1 att/def base -> net +1 att
-- Some price increase for all sailing commanders, so Shamans and Sky Seers are 5g worse price-wise. (55->60,75->80); 
-- Severe price hit for rec-everywhere sacreds (so they don't have lower upkeep than regular troops while being way stronger), 40/45/55g -> 60/65/70g
-- Corrected Blackwing Elder leadership disparity
-- Dry Kryluds prot 6->5 (so Drywings are far better than Elites as frontline fighters with E9, and Dry Kryluds only have advantage of low fireres/coldres)
-- Increased Blackwings price to 3 gems for single summon, 15 gems for 4 and 22 gems for abyssal 6, Horde summons 20+ for 40 gems (more expensive than Army of the Wights).
-- A 20% conj bonus affects those low-tier summons beneficially.
-- Removed 10% randoms from all of Warlocks and Deepseers.
-- --		MA
-- Stygians darkvision 25->75.
-- Stygian Elders leadership 40->60 like other two Elders.

-- --		MA/LA
-- Priests of Light poorleaders.

-- Stoneslingers +1 prec
-- F2/A2/W2 Priests price decreased by ~10
-- --		LA
-- Hegude Elite 13g->12g.
-- --	--	Ochrehulk (MINOR)
-- Idealcold 3 for MA and LA both (nation severly suffers from not having maximal iceprot, so why grant free points?..) 
-- Removed Crystalcrafters from LA (now Newbloods, Rutsminers, Goldsmiths and Sages)
-- To be done. Primordial Ochrehulk summon, F1W1E3N1 + FWN2 +0.5 E.
-- Jadehulk 50g price.
-- --	--	Vilium/Malevil (MAJOR)
-- Corrected Ritual of Movement (and Banner of Call to Arms for that matter); it's affected by Arcane lens and Tome of High Power, so it's more powerful gamechanger.
-- Note: all of those idols are terribly vulnerable to Soul Slays! Need a MR booster. Lifeblood Contract is just terrible
-- Changed nametypes to Ulmish and Wooden.
-- Lowered ea/la troops to 15/15 once again,
-- 10/10 troops, Soulforge as starting scout for MA/LA (+50 resources, turn 7/9 soulforge summoning)
-- Changed nametypes to Ulmish.
-- Beefed up Father of Idols (who, actually, makes very bad NB-bless chassis since it's grossly overpriced, and no gemprod saves him since he comes dormant/imprisoned or with all negatives)
-- Changed Craving Idol requirements to B2H2 (so EA has difficulties massing them)
-- Enchanted Lumber provides both Nature and Fire gems
-- --		LA
-- Vilium: changed income D1 S3 -> E1 S3
-- Malevil: Added extra B1 magic for mages, now FANB1 H2 + ?1 / H3 + ?2.1
-- --	--	Observers
-- ...Why did I add this nation, try your guess? Obviously, it didn't make it into official 1.22, but don't be surprised if I forget removing it in future.
-- --	--	TODO
-- Idle observation: I've got 160 - 25% more pure Fire mages and 96 - 25% fewer pure Earth mages in modpack than ~120 Water/Air, if only base paths are taken into account.
-- For sorcery, there are ~120 - 33% more Astral users, and ~100 Death mages, but ~95 Nature and Blood mages.
-- Adding to this the Azeroth (with several ambassadors, dalaran/quel'thalas/ironforge/aerie peak/possibly kul tiras?) and Baal, 
-- ...trend of Frying Sorcery only continues (both are major Fire and Astral users with lots of those mages)
-- Add Ochehulk summons, expand on LA Sages, add LA heroes. Add something for WS crosspath!
-- Expand Tetrachires national theme ?
-- Expand Krylud shark theme? Hero Shark Lord?
-- Expand Hegude lore connections?
-- Work on Vilium/Malevil heroes, they're just bland (only Raven has any work put into it) and don't quite fit for MA/LA.
-- Add a bit more nation-defining stuff for Malevil?
-- Add Fire/Air/Nature gemprod chassis for Vilium and Malevil? Something like F1N1B1 Burnblood Spirit (+2f, popkill as a side-effect) /N2B1 Bloodhenge Spirit (+2n)
-- Beheaded One has already taken place as a versatile, and most importantly extremely flexible/affordable equivalent of the Neter of the Moon/Old Man of the Sea. 
--	A4E4B4 allows to break into any elemental path from X1 mage with +2 boosts (Water being the only with common body booster, and Air just lacks summonable mages)
--	It allows S4 mages to build the RoS/RoW, and demon summoning is easy with B4 mage.
--	Death and Nature are easy to break into, it requires a N2 or N1S1 mage and D1 mage is all it takes to climb.
--	Of course, scales suffer from having awake researcher of such magnitude, but it's not THAT bad; nations with low-level key spells win the most.
--	Nations with Air summons... well, suffice to say there aren't any YET.
-- Add site-tied events using vanilla sites and my nations when appropriate?
-- 227 Solar Circle - EA Zel fire boosting for priests, sorcerers and Striders as a common event. Only at summer solstice.
-- 239 The Temple of the Raging God - EA Brutannia gets cookies, LA Brutannia too.
-- 243 Dragon Forest - spawn a Red Dragon uncommon good for any of dragon nations. Unique.
-- 269 Dragon Cliff - spawn a Green Dragon uncommon good for any of dragon nations. Unique.
-- 290 Dragon Mountain - spawn a Blue Dragon uncommon good for any of dragon nations. Unique
-- 301 Dragon Jaws - spawn a Red Dragon uncommon good for any of dragon nations. Unique.
-- 1033 Dragon Lair - spawns a Red Dragon uncommon good for any of dragon nations. Unique.

-- Doomsworn Conquerors paths  are now A1 W1 +0.2FAWES (previous version didn't mention them being changed to A1 W1 + 0.1 FAWES)
-- Doombrand Area Doom effect is AN as intended. Still F3B3 since there are three 1% events banishing the wielder of this twohanded sword... 
-- Having Doomsworn Champion wield it quite hilarious though, as it'll drop out unless munched by Doom Horrors and kill stuff with its SC-tier stats.
-- Doomsworn Pyromancers 0.25% AESB -> 0.2 FAWES random
-- Doomsworn High Lords price increased iirc 250-> 295g

-- It narrowed out-of-cap path access to A2W2 FNDB1 0.033E, though elite magweapon troops and mass sailing somewhat make up for this.

-- --	--***	VERSION 1.19
-- --	Changelog template
-- --	--	GENERAL
-- Revised many summaries. They're now prettier and mostly correct. Started tidying up the national entries (so they are all sorted), but not done yet
-- Nerfed Titan of Darkness to only produce Solar Eclipse every battle; expend gems if you want a proper Darkness cast.
-- All of heroes are now unique, preventing wishing for such thing as Last Darkslayer or Avatar of Pyrgdor many times over. Their latehero values are amended as well.
-- Avatar of Doom gained unique Doomblade Focus, still weaker than Sword of sharpness, but as len 5 default piece of equipment that'll do.
-- Incidentally, a wish for Pit Lord is hardly less impressive than Seraph, since that bugger is SC-tier in melee combat with defnegates dmg 60+ against anything smaller than 6.
-- --	--	SPRITES
-- Ochrekan oreseekers
-- thunder lance - drawn?
-- --	--	Swarmhive
-- Fixed summary. It was wrong since Mind Blast isn't on board; far less potent Mental Shock is.
-- --	--	EA
-- Myrmec Princes are multiheroes for the nation, either.
--		R'lyehive
-- Dang, it stil needs name. Fixed Aboleth freespawn which  got broken.
-- Reduced Gharoide Pups popkill; going for mad tribless E9N9B9 Monolith is surprisingly viable with the prospect of insects reducing world to smoking Ermorian ash anyway.
-- Increased Gharoide price to 20 pearls; still feels cheap for a dominion-based freespawn; 
-- As an aside: rushing straight Conj 6 feels immensely attractive, even if nuking 2 own provinces is a given.
-- --	--	Brutannia
-- --		EA
-- Brutal Fire/Flames are armor piercing.
-- Removed fire shield from spirits of war, added reinvigoration and increased reform abilities. No built-in magic anymore.
-- --		MA
-- Removed Blood magic access through Chieftains, but increased their Fire magic to 50%
-- --		LA
-- Doombrand causes AOE 1 feeblemind since it didn't work.
-- Doomsworn Conquerors are poor researchers -2 at same 180 gold, but are "merely" 40 years old instead of 50.
-- Doomsworn Mistresses have W magic, enabling AW crosspath.
-- Lowered Prophet of Doom deserting chance.
-- Fixed hero1 to hero2, enabling Kaempedo to spawn for the nation.
-- Tiered costs for Heralds at 80/90/100 slaves.
-- --	--	Electrum
-- Added Thunder Lance item, brand-like non-artifact A2E1 Const 6 Tempest with shockres 15, Storm Power and Summon Storm Power. 
-- (Make 'yer SCs fly through Perpetual Storms!)
-- All of Thunder giants gained Overcharged 10. Altar of Thunder also did.
-- Others didn't, since those expensive size 5 brutes need a distinctive trait apart from Lightning Swarm and being able to kill just about anything.
-- --	--	Zel/Sandeth
-- Lessened the latehero for heroes. Rejuvenated the Solar Avvim.
-- Added a Solar eagle to cheapgods (...or whatever 2785 is)
-- Reworked the Solar Striders, making them F3 and not Power of the Spheres; 
-- Not StR and more expensive than Sorcerers, but terrible researchers. Overall, good for combat, but nothing more.
-- --	--	Dassem
-- Lessened the latehero for Demon Hunters and Bloodblade elders.
-- --		EA
-- Upgraded EA Dassem to PaliForts instead of rotting Palisades (since it was uncalled for)
-- Infernal Pledge boosts the blood of smallish Demonologists.
-- --	--	Arcania/ Cannum
-- --		EA
-- Corrected Namasur sprite and Arcanian Champion freespawn.
-- Arcanian Fencers cost 27 gold, unlike Lancers and Archers; still markedly better damage output; most heroes are latehero 20.
-- --		MA
-- Arcanian Fencers cost 40 gold, while Lancers and Archers cost 35.
-- --	--	Tetrachires
-- Removed Javelin of Flight from pretender god.
-- Major boost for national thugs: everyone has two misc slots instead of one. Jewelry, y'know.
-- --		EA
-- Ice Shamans cost 145 gold, as compensation for both higher random and leadership.
-- --		MA
-- Smiths cost 160 gold, have -1 research penalty, but produce 10 resources each. Far tougher and diverse than Ulm MS.
-- Masters of the Dau cost only 270 gold.
-- Priests of the Dau reduce unrest by 1.0.
-- --		LA
-- Increased defense score of cap-only Knights and Champions. No longer more vulnerable than Defenders!
-- --	--	Pyrgdor
-- Changed hated terrains to small provinces, mountains and swamps.
-- Increased fire resistance of fireres 15 troops to 20; lowered Spirit Champions and Grinch resistances.
-- --	--	Robbledoth
-- Added Fort of Ash and Bones for all ages, which creates a flimsy Palisades at Enchantment 5 for mere 35 death gems. Elegant for EA, useful for LA.
-- Consider Adding a spell for temple and laboratory creation for LA, too?
-- --		LA
-- Reduced popkill back to 0.1%/candle (if 1 = 0.1%?)
-- --	--	Drakonia
-- Basalt King hero received forge bonus 1->2 and turn arrival limit. Skydrake lost it. Dragons are turn 25+ arrival; need more low-tier heroes.
-- --	--	MA Horde
-- Felorcs are part of Dark Portal Rift recruitment lineup, need a Pit Lord. 
-- Vastly superior to your regular orcs for same 12 gold, but... well, a pit lord at home is a lazy pit lord..
-- Pit lords att 12->15, def 10-> 12; reinvig 3->5;
-- (Armor of Souls, helmet, regeneration, shock/cold resists, and Flying Carpet will make them into SCs)
-- --	--	Sukarakoyash
-- Karakylych demand upkeep like proper trolls.
-- Shadow Messenger only costs 5->3 gems.
-- Heroes have latehero 15 and 25, since Shadescreamer is scary teleporter and Shadowshifter is scary assassin.
-- --	--	Krylud
-- Added Titan of the Sea, lowered Bind Blackwing conj 3->2. Fixed shark amulet.
-- --		MA
-- Stygian Warriors cost 50->45 gold, since they aren't actually anything special.
-- --		LA
-- Drywing Warlocks have H1 magic.
-- --	--	Ruthum
-- Added eyeloss to Celestial Minotaurs/Immolators
-- Changed starting armies to 15 Prowlers, 15 Elites and 10/5 Elites/Crossbows.
-- Increased cavemen prices: +1 hp, lowest-tier 18->19g, Shieldbearers/EA Warriors 20->21g, MA/LA elites/crossbow 22->23, 26g for guards.
-- Reasoning: being tougher than Bandar and costing the same while also being slaves, resistant to stuff and having +1 survival isn't proper.
-- Seriously, even nation having significantly worse magicks doesn't really explain it away.
-- Reduced Master Immolator and Grand Immolator prices. Fixed hero2 for EA, Embercoal is latehero 10 now.
--		LA
-- Prowler Lord is Expert leader, but not inspirational ("cunning generals")
-- --	--	Hegude
-- Added Blessing of the River spell and took away a misc slot from the dragon hero.

-- Electrum archer/spear militia sprites.
-- Ochrehulk heroes and fluff summons etc.


-- --	--	--***	VERSION 1.18

-- Reduced Grinch base stealth to 15

-- ***	VERSION 1.10

-- Dassem Bodyguards price increased (they have high stats, AND poison weapon, AND bodyguard; even if capped you can just spam forts like no tomorrow since you're most certainly rolling with Sloth 3 anyway)
-- Dassem Officers are now 80 leadership and cost 125. Some ACTUALLY GOOD commander, at last!
-- Improved Devil Guards. A lot. They are now competitive with Demon Knights and come in pairs.
-- Added Triton Assassins/Captains/Bodyguards for improved underwater warfare (assassins are rec-everywhere, like Old Assassins or Preachers, but captains are worse than Old Assassins)
-- Dassem gained extra troop summoning spell for B3 mages, commanders for B4 and Bloodblades for B5. Summoned troops
-- MA Dassem: Edomite assassins XD. Seriously, what are those Bloodblades trying to pull off?..
-- It's worth notice that as of now MA Dassem has three useful assassins and sailing A1N1, 
-- while LA Dassem has lab-free leadership +1 size 3 spy sailors and three D1/N1/B1 terrain-recruitment mages and cap-only mercenary recruitment
-- Arcania/Cannum: Ether Warriors no longer need a D random (making them a viable summon for MA Cannum)
-- MA Cannum: ---NOTHING ADDED, FWS combo magic proved to be pretty devastating by itself.  AED is just icing on the cake.
-- Robbledoth: Terror of the Mooses was increased in cost. Pretty weird spell, as there are few casters to use it natively, especially in EA :)
-- Brutannia: nerfed the Flame Strike to -6 non-AP Brutal Flames (less killy)
-- Add armored wasterec unit to EA Quadro - Outcasts.
-- Increased pillagebonus on Fire Tetrachires and Quadro Kin to 2 and 3.

-- get chance to actually summon Bane and Longdead using cap commanders
-- (F2D2 paths Red Jarl with Skull staff and Skull of Fire/Flame Helmet, or A2D2 paths Vandragen Jarl with Skull staff and Winged helmet) The sacred recruitment is still pretty non-existent.
-- Either way, exceedingly easy to convert gems to magic power on a tough chassis.
-- EA Drakonia: added extra random for all of Dragonborn, 25% chance of extra primary magic path. So StRing them isn't quite as meaningless.
-- LA Brutannia added
-- Electrum Improved Thunderstorm giants with +1 ammo. All of giants now have Thick Hair helmet :)
-- Bronze Crafters removed StR, their cave limitation is bad enough.
-- Add MA Dauchires E1 + 2FAWE smith. Smith. Check.
-- Fix Pyrgdor, nobody seems to like it. Check - now they're absolutely crzy gblns.


-- --	--	--***	VERSION 1.09
-- IDs reshuffled
-- Swarmhive: nerfed Onslaught of the Swarm some more, upping it to 400 cost, still W4H3 and Ench 6 though. Need Water gems supply for it to work.

-- Reduced Blood Fecundity bonus (so it no longer boosts pop increase this well for EA.

-- Dragonkin warriors... NOT discounted (even if Drakonic are better)
-- Lindwurm secondshape fixed.

-- Now compatible with both summod and Magic Enhanced. At least I *think* so.
-- Most spells no longer are #copyspell and thus don't look weird
-- Swarmhive: Increased Swarm Archer/Infantry hp to 11. Swarm Guardian hp 12.
-- LA Swarmhive: added squishy human Evoker with F2E1S1 magic. All that for 140g! Now, don't get anxious, there's still no D or B.
-- Swarm Knights and Godsworn Knights are 5g cheaper.
-- Warworkers are rcost 12 now (more dakka!), so they aren't way slower to recruit than Warriors.
-- WC1 Horde: complete, some tweaks to stats. Last-minute fixes included. (*sigh*)
-- Arcania: all of units gained 50% Darkvision, partially mitigating the Blacksteel Night disadvantages and making it usable. Solar Eclipse is very usable for MA elite armies, too.
-- LA Quad-Zax: added S1B1H1X1 Adepts, renaming old B1X1 to Initiates. Shamans are no longer sacred, and are 95g FE2 0.35FAWE evokers (very cheap).

-- MA Brutannia: removed caster discounts.

-- Rebalanced EA Arcania national spells. Added Ether Warrior summoning spell for 6 pearls.

-- Return the Arcanian is now single D4H1 spell for 35 Death gems. Arcanians are X3Y2H2 immortals.

-- Nerfed Brigadeers, Controllers and Cosmo Godborn. Mind Blast -> Mental Shock (crossbow firing rate), Brigadeers cost unchanged, Controllers cost +5.
-- All of Godborn except Lesser ones now have magical bite. Aquaborn and Pyroborn remain the only ones with AP weapon though.
-- Brutannia: added MA Brutannia, EA Brutannia gained Brutal Warsmiths (dedicated sacred forger), Reduced resource bonus to 7.
-- Drakonia: fixed poison barbs for Bone Drakes
-- Dassem: so much new stuff it's now actually worth picking. Also, MA and LA are no longer identical, LA gets more tiny mages whereas MA has harabs and sidhes.
-- WC1 horde: not all spites done yet :(


--***	VERSION 1.06
-- WC1 Horde added to MA nations (Sukarakoyash still isn't added), but not all summons available
-- Short summary: Orcish recruits are stronger than average unit, yet require B2F3 enchantment active to be recruited. Trolls are meh, poorly armored regenerators with throwing junk.
-- Non-demonic summons from blood, Doomguards, Eredars, Dreadlords, Infernal
-- Dassem: nerfed Devil Guard Contract to be B5S1 - now 2 expensive blood boosters neede to forge it from a rare Master Demonologist, and it's not much more cost-effective than summoning 5 Devil Guards.
-- Drakonia: some fixes to new Sages (extra waste survival and lack of temp recruitment on Red Sages.
-- Electrum: Enslaved Cavemen are no longer capital recruits (it was weird, honestly!)
-- Brutannia: Warsmiths now can research (useless with Drain, obviously)
-- Swarmhive: Cosmo Godborns reduced to 40g cost (there's 40g rec-everymountain Brigadeers who compete)
-- Added Marmec King pretender
-- Raised training speed for EA (so MA gets more incentive to use its very, very sturdy sacred infantry)
-- Quadro/Dauchires/Quad-Zax: cost increase for elite units/sommanders, excepting Rock Quads (dual slings aren't very cool)
-- Lowered Bind Tetradaemon research to 4 and added Blood7 B4S3 Tetradaemon Attack (FAWE1 S1 H1 commander and 5+ units) at 99 slaves.
-- It's pretty effective cost-wise (with B5 mage and better, ofc - B9Sx summons 12 attackers, combined with throne effects it might be quite bad)

-- ***	VERSION 1.05 hotfix
-- EA Swarmhive: cap sites are back!
-- LA Drakonia: Red/green sages had Beastmaster reduced, while Green Wingborn gained this ability.

-- ***	VERSION 1.05
-- Sukarakoyash isn't included (not finished yet)
-- Brutannia: Removed summon allies from all recruitable Brutannia leaders, replacing it with incprovdef instead. ('twas overboard, honestly)

-- Swarmhive: Replaced domrec 2 with domrec 1
-- Swarmhive: even more buffs (improved terrain recruitment, decreased recruitment costs, etc, but nothing major like increasing domsummon/paths)
-- Drakonia: reduced #taskmaster to 2 (Greatsword Barbarian Slaves are actually very, very strong damage dealers!)
-- Drakonia: added MA/LA Drake Warriors, replaced Dragonkin Sages with Red Sage and Blue sage with F2+AE+0.1FAE and W2+AE+0.1WAE correspondingly
-- Electrum: reduced resources bonus down to 10 max.
-- Arcania/Cannum: Crossbowmen got shifted to LA only (why? 'cause this makes more sense)

-- Pyrgdor: lots of tweaks and lore changes
-- EA wolf riders got reduced to Raider Archers out of cap
-- LA sacreds got 30g cost. Some other fixes were made.

-- Added Devil Guard Pact item for EA/MA
-- EA Zel: Implemented shortbow with ammo 9
-- Solar Striders are now proper heavy cavalry unit.
-- Some lore clarifications


-- ***	VERSION 1.04

-- Arcania: Fixed Arcanian heroes MR (it was 15, which is odd for Ether Lord-based heroes)
-- Swarmhive: Further reduced non-warrior Myrmecs costs

-- ***	VERSION 1.03
-- Sukarakoyash isn't included (not finished yet)
-- Dassem: nerfed Master Demonologists, so they are less good as researchers and cost more

-- Robbledoth: added minor popkill/freespawn event for its dominions, and Curse of Starvation B1D1 spell (remote attack/death scale tipping)

-- Dassem: increased Blood magic to level 2. Now it's one of the most magically diverse nation in MA, and even in LA they are formidable.
-- Improved Bodyguards - added +2 att, but replaced cap with hood. They are limited recruitment anyway.
-- Robbledoth: fixed recruitment list
-- Electrum: skirmishers at 25g

-- ***	VERSION 1.01
-- Sukarakoyash isn't included (not finished yet)
-- Arcania: removed scale spread from Ether Hawks, reducing their summoning cost. Added Ether Surge.
-- Swarmhive: changed national color to green, and generally buffed nation since it wasn't really up to par.
-- Generally reduced the costs for anything, improved Warriors weapon, buffed LA humans. Since really, they just didn't cut it.
-- added several national spells - three battlefield-wide buffs and two skelespam spells.
-- Pyrgdor: Pyrg Raiders cost increased (since they are sacreds AoE flamethrowers - why were they this cheap???)

-- ***	VERSION 1.00 of mod pack
-- Sukarakoyash isn't included (not finished yet)
