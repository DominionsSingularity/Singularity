#version 1.5

-- Each nationa sits in its own section, delimited by -- @@@@[Name of nation] - [version number]. This makes the nations easy to split apart as separate mods if desired.



--- VERSION 1.5 CHANGES (this is the first one of these because in version 1.5 I stopped maintaining the individual nation mods and now all updates will be made to the compilation mod)

--------------------- GENERAL ------------------------

-- TWEAK -- Removed the unique tag from various national heroes. It brought more cons than pros and I generally didn't use it, but there were some holdouts left
-- TWEAK -- Added many square bracketed bits of mechanical information at the end of unit descriptions, to help the player make sense of things that don't have icons etc



--------------------- BRETONNIA -----------------------
-- TWEAK -- Fort PD improved


--------------------- CHAOS DWARFS -----------------------
-- MECHANIC -- When Chaos Dwarfs own or siege a fort they pollute the province towards death 1 if it has neutral or positive growth scales, so you might want to not take growth as chaos dwarfs!
-- TWEAK -- Forts now give 10% extra resources, like a toned down version of the MA Ulm ability
-- TWEAK -- Fireglaive infantry now reclimited and the fireglaive itself does less damage against single targets, plus goldcost increased 36 -> 40
-- TWEAK -- Slave Giant gold cost decreased from 280 -> 240
-- TWEAK -- Slave contracts no longer have death recruitment discount, but gold cost reduced 5 -> 4
-- TWEAK -- Immortal gold cost decreased 40 -> 35, and they now have halved gold upkeep like a sacred


--------------------- DARK ELVES -----------------------
-- TWEAK -- Doomfire Warlocks goldcost increased 50 -> 65, also reclimited to 2 per turn

-- FIX -- Dwarf hero preview site now correctly treats them as commanders not troops
-- FIX -- Rangers and Ranger Captains no longer have pointless ambidexterity

--------------------- EMPIRE -----------------------
-- FIX -- Gold Lion Grandmaster now has correct mapmove
-- TWEAK -- All Knightly Orders are now significantly cheaper (around 25% cheaper generally)

--------------------- HIGH ELVES -----------------------
-- FIX -- Summoning great eagles now requires air gems not water gems

#descr "Marauder tribes make extensive use of large hounds to track and hunt beasts, warn them of dangers, or run down tired and fleeing foes. The largest and most ferocious of these are taken into battle to be unleashed on the enemy lines, a snarling wave of muscle, tooth, and claw. Chaos Warhounds often sport mutations and those that have been touched by the influence of Chaos tend to be even more dangerous, making them prized possessions for Marauder Chieftains.

#descr "While only Warriors, Sorcerers, and Champions of Chaos can truly hope to draw the eye of one of the Ruinous Powers, all manner of other men and beasts are subject to the warping taint of Chaos through proximity alone. Many of the men and women of the countless Marauder tribes are born with mutations, reminders of the constant presence of their Gods. These mutants are not ostracised or culled as they might be in the weak realms of civilised men but are instead treated with respect and honour. Those with the extreme mutations typically do not survive to adulthood but some join the marauders and unleash the blessing of their altered form upon the foe in a frenzied headlong rush. They are known as the Forsaken amongst the ranks of the Warriors, but to the Marauders they are a venerated elite that demonstrate the favour of the Gods."

#name "Chaos Ogre"
#descr "Ogres are large humanoid creatures known for their gluttony, strength, and love of violence. While they are typically quite resistant to both the warping taint of Chaos and the tempting whispers of the Dark Prince, they are naturally drawn to promises of excess and violence and so can often be found in the forces of Slaanesh. Even fairly small Marauder forces can occasionally find themselves benefitting from the presence of a handful of Ogres because these creatures are natural opportunists and recognise that in a smaller force they can bully their way to getting a larger share of the loot. Chaos Ogres have, despite their natural resistances, been changed by their exposure to Chaos and the attentions of the Ruinous Powers and are even stronger and more ferocious fighters than their former fellows in the Ogre Kingdoms."

Steeds constantly taste the air with their long, whiplike tongues, sampling the scents and flavours of souls carried by the ever present the Winds of Magic and they are capable of hunting down almost any quarry. In battle the Marauder lashes his foes with a life draining Hellscourge whip while the Steed's tongue whips out at lightning speed, delivering poisons both deadly and psychoactive. Should the Marauder be struck from his Steed the beast will fight on for the rest of the battle before returning to the Realm of Chaos.

It is their purpose not only to attend to Slaanesh's whimsical desires, but muster his armies, take care of military details which would bore the Dark Prince, and carry his creed to the mortal realm. Slaanesh is always hungry for morsels of courtly intrigue and such scraps can lead to the corrupting of a mortal ruler, a matter to which the Lord of Excess is always attentive. At times the Heralds carry their master's word to specific individuals singled out for divine notice. Not all such visitations are welcomed by those who receive them, for Slaanesh is nothing if not effusive in his tempers. In battle Heralds are powerful champions imbued with grace, might, and presence by their benefactor. As with all Daemons of Chaos these decadent creatures are highly resistant to physical attacks but grow weaker outside the Dominion of their God. Heralds are messengers of Slaanesh's will an as such have priestly authority.

#descr "Daemon Princes were once mortals, Chaos Lords that so pleased their patron God that the ultimate prize of immortality was bestowed upon them, along with a new form embodying the essence of the Chaos God that elevated them. Unlike Daemons, even Greater Daemons, a part of the Daemon Prince is forever its own, distinct from the sprawling energy of the God that granted it such power, for the Ruinous Powers enjoy seeing the schemes and ambitions of their most favoured followers play out across eternity. Daemon Princes of Slaanesh tend to take on serpentine traits, grow new limbs ending in impossibly sharp pincer claws, and exude an aura of sensuality that can greatly heighten or almost entirely dull the senses of those unfortunate enough to stand before them. While Chaos Lords of Slaanesh rely on Sorcerers or Shamans, Daemon Princes have an innate talent for sorcery in addition to their considerable martial prowess and physical might. While they are Daemons in form their past in the mortal world grants Daemon Princes the benefit of not becoming weaker outside the Dominion of their God, though like Greater Daemons they can still only reform their bodies if slain in this Dominion."

#descr "Most Marauder tribes will have one or two Shamans whose duty is to offer counsel to the Chieftain, interpret auguries to ensure successful raids, and lead the tribe in offering the proper observances to their patron God. Shamans tend to have only a little magical talent and rather than harnessing energy provided by the Ruinous Powers, they tap into the magic of their surroundings in the manner of hedge mages, witches, and other lesser mages. Shamans thus practice a different branch of magic from Sorcerers focused on veneration of the dead, the wilds, and the bitter cold of the polar lands. Shamans of Marauder tribes dedicated to Slaanesh in the guise of the Serpent carry staffs topped with snake skeletons and have some talent in the magic of the spheres and the minds of mortals.

Rather Marauder Chieftains are picked out by their Shamans and by former Chiefs to take the position, selected on the basis that they clearly have some favour from the Ruinous Powers, but have not attracted the potentially lethal full attention of their Patron God. The Marauder tribes are well known for their raids by sea and Marauder Chieftains can command fleets of cramped but efficient longboats to bear Marauders and Warriors to battle, though they aren't nearly large enough to transport cavalry."

#name "Keeper of Secrets"
#descr "The Greater Daemons of Slaanesh are known as Keepers of Secrets, for they are the confidants and courtiers of Slaanesh, as well as the greatest generals and warriors of the Dark Prince. A Keeper of Secrets is a ruiner of purity, a despoiler of the faithful, and the harbinger of damnation. It draws strength from the corruption of others and above all feasts on upon mortal excess and rapture, particularly if it can deliver its target from the heights of one to the depths of another. Keepers are the . Each varies in appearance to some extent and each considers itself the true paragon of beauty, but they share in common certain bovine aspects to their appearance, four arms and two legs, and a visage which combines horror and sensuality in writhing union. Keepers are matchless in their grace and agility, even amongst other Greater Daemons, capable of dancing through ranks of elite enemies and tearing them apart with contemptuous ease. The Keeper's lethality is not limited to its physical prowess, however, for they are also talented and powerful magic users possessing a supernatural ability to travel undetected and strike at appropriate targets from the shadows. As with all Daemons they are more powerful within the Dominion of their God and as Greater Daemons they are capable of reforming their body should they be slain in this Dominion.

[This Keeper of Secrets has been tasked with the seduction and corruption of females and so is considered male for the purposes of the Seduction command]

#name "Prince of the Sortsvinaer"
#descr "Styrkaar was born to a Chieftain of the Norscan tribe known as the Sortsvinaer and marked from birth as one destined for a special fate, as it became clear he was bound to a Daemonic entity, Sle'zuzu. Following the whisperings of the Daemon the young boy became a charming and successful princeling and led many successful raids on the coasts of the Old World. His father was eaten away by jealousy and insulted his son, who murdered him the midst of a great revelry in Styrkaar's honour. As he grew in status and embarked on the Path of the Champion Styrkaar's mind merged with that of the Daemon and he became truly favoured by Slaanesh, granted pale daemonic flesh, fine black armour, and his own Daemonic Mount. Styrkaar was one of the four Chaos Lords chosen by Archaon the Everchosen to head armies in support of his invasion of the Old World and it is clear that he is still destined for greater things."

#name "Such Sights to Show You"
#descr "Extending a hand in a delicate gesture, the caster beckons an enemy with a vision of the sights, sensations, unimaginable terrors, and impossible pleasures that Slaanesh might offer them. Those who fail to resist will immediately join the forces of Slaanesh. The Prince of Pleasure delights in corrupting even those most righteous, wise, or protected from magic and only Pretenders or those with no mind at all are entirely safe from this spell. Though the caster smiles and laughs melodically as they unleash the vision, the spell is very tiring to cast."

This ritual creates a single mindless Chaos Spawn, the form of which can vary greatly. Chaos Spawn of Slaanesh are fast moving by the standards of their kind and typically attack their foes with tentacles, tongues, and armour piercing pincer claws. Though they are truly creatures of Chaos they are not Daemons."

Fiends are rather more delicate and less physically powerful than the beasts of the other Ruinous Powers but their speed, reflexes, and armour shredding pincers make them formidable indeed, as does the poisonous stinger with which they send their prey into a coma.

Furthermore Daemon Princes are innately talented sorcerers and have all the benefits of Daemonhood, even including the ability to reform their body should they be slain within the Dominion of Slaanesh, but without the drawback of being weaker outside of this Dominion."

---------------- WELCOME TO SLAANESH -----------------

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! Slaanesh has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:

Path of the Warrior. Your Chaos Warriors and Knights can, through XP, earn the chance to be promoted to a Chosen. This won't trigger until the turn after the game announces their promotion and will only happen when they are outside of their home province (for technical reasons). They will then face the judgement of Slaanesh and may be either Chosen, Forsaken, or twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn.

Path of the Champion. Your military commanders can also earn promotion for a chance of a more powerful form, though unlike the troops it can trigger even in their home province. Aspiring Champions can become Exalted Heroes who can become Chaos Lords who can reach the final stage and become a Daemon Prince. At each stage of judgement it may please Slaanesh to turn them into a mindless Chaos Spawn (killing them and giving you a Spawn as a troop), though the Spawn generated will tend to be more powerful than those you get from failed troop promotions.

Dominion of Sensation. Your dominion has increased importance because some recruitables are locked behind minimum levels, your Daemons are weaker outside your dominion, and your dominion decreases unrest for provinces you control and increases it if the enemy does, based on its strength."

#descr "Slaanesh is one of the four Ruinous Powers, the Gods of Chaos that draw strength from the darkest mortal emotions and drives. Slaanesh is known as the Prince of Pleasure, for their domain is extreme sensation, fear, and lust. Each of the Ruinous Powers seeks dominion over the realms of mortals and advantage over their siblings, for to them all life is but a game. Greatest in number of the followers of Slaanesh are the Marauders, hardened human warriors from the tribes that surround the Chaos Wastes and are sometimes joined by Ogres or Trolls drawn by the prospect of great reward. Above the Marauders in status are the Chaos Warriors, elite fighters blessed with martial prowess and physical strength, and the Chosen Warriors who show Slaanesh's direct favour. Commanding the followers of Slaanesh are Champions, Exalted Heroes, and Chaos Lords, each of which seeks to some day ascend to immortality in the form of a Daemon Prince, though most on this path will die in battle or displease Slaanesh and be twisted into a mindless Chaos Spawn. Finally the Daemons of Slaanesh are the most direct and horrifying servants of the Dark Prince, for they are the essence of Slaanesh given form and unleashed upon the world."

#summary "Race: Hardened humans with partial cold resistance, beasts of Chaos. Prefer Cold +2

#descr "Unlike Men-at-Arms the bow armed peasants often deployed in Bretonnian armies are not a standing militia and are given no equipment or uniform by the knights who muster them. Rather they are sommonfolk who simply seek to earn respite from the hard toil of their day to day lives and perhaps even a little extra coin or food by joining an army. Hunting and games of archery are both popular amongst the commonfolk of Bretonnia and the bow is a common weapon of community defence, as even simple weapons such as spears are forbidden to those who are not Men-at-Arms. Consequently mobs of bowmen are quick and easy to gather should a Lord require them, though they are such a disorganised and foolish rabble that no noble would even try to issue them orders on the battlefield."

#descr "Though Bretonnia is quite strictly divided between commoner and nobility, there are different degrees of social status within the masses of the commonfolk, just as there are amongst the aristocracy. The Yeomen are commoners who are permitted to own their homes and trusted to lead other peasants, having been marked out by the ruler of their fief as having served particularly faithfully. One of the most common routes to the status of Yeomen is brave service and experience in the Men-at-Arms, though this comes at considerable risk. Yeoman soldiers are better trained, better equipped, and more dedicated in battle than any Man-at-Arms and while they are by no means respected by the knights, they are trusted to give a good enough account of themselves. They are quite often used to guard forts and castles and are experienced in defending such structures."

Although Knights would never stoop to using such weapons, there is a rich tradition of archery in the lands of Bretonnia that goes beyond the basic needs of hunters and wardens. Longbowmen pick out new recruits to the Yeoman soldiery who and induct them into the use of the Longbow, a much more powerful bow than any a peasant would be allowed for hunting or the like. Longbow units tend to be quite well drilled, as they are given dispensation to practice as a group on a routine basis, setting aside the usual labour required of them. Consequently the position of Yeoman Longbowman is a coveted one, as it represents one of the best lots in life in which a commoner can find himself."

#name "Knight Errant"
#descr "All noble sons of Bretonnia are committed to the path of knighthood from the moment they are born, but while their noble blood ensures them a place amongst the aristocracy, a young noble will not be honoured until he has proven himself. Knights Errant are the youngest Knights with the most to prove, known for their brash arrogance, thirst for glory, and impetuous nature. They rarely listen to orders and indeed it is rather expected that they should not, for no knight should stand to be without honour and the surest way to earn it is in a headlong charge into the foe. Some Lords see the reckless charge of the Errants to be a necessary way of pruning the ranks, others simply a suitable outlet for the insecurity and enthusiasm of youth, but none would deny a young knight his chance at destiny. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation. They ride purebreed Destriers that are amongst the finest steeds in the world and selectively bred to easily support the weight of an armoured rider."

#descr "It is unusual for a Bretonnian knight to take the field without a steed, but Destriers are highly expensive and the holdings of some noble families simply cannot afford one for every son, and no knight of Bretonnia would consider riding a lesser horse. Lacking a steed is particularly hard on impetuous young Knights Errant because it greatly curtails their ability to seek glory, and thus honour, in a headlong charge into battle. That said it is impressed on every knight that they are no lesser than their mounted fellows for fighting on foot and can and must seek their destiny in battle, so Knights Errant remain just as impetuous and uncontrollable even when fighting on foot. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation."

They are granted a small fief from within their family's holdings, or, in rare cases, from land personally controlled by a Lord or Duke. Just as the peasants living in the fief then owe their fealty to the knight, the knight owes his to his Lord. It is a common saying that the Knights of the Realm are the shield of Bretonnia, but in battle they act more like its armoured fist, punching directly through the enemy line and shattering their forces. Knights of the Realm are expected to personally deal with lesser threats to their fief and are well practiced at rooting out hidden foes or troublemakers.

#descr "The greatest honour that any noble of Bretonnia can receive is to drink from the Grail and receive the blessing of the Lady. This honour calls out to a great many nobles and to resist the call, once it comes, is to invite an existence tortured by doubt and regret, to forever more ask 'what if?'. No matter how wealthy, influential, or powerful the noble there is only one way to receive a blessing from the Grail and that is to take the Questing Vow, leaving behind both lands and lance. Questing Knights roam the lands with very few possessions seeking out danger and adventure to prove themselves worthy of the Grail. Their quests are typically long and dangerous, often ending in failure and as nearly likely to end in the death of the noble. Questing Knights are well known for their thirst for glory and often seek to fell the largest beasts on the battlefield with great two handed swords designed explicitly to cut down large foes. Having given up the trappings of nobility their upkeep is only a quarter of that required by a Knight of the Realm."

Their numbers are made of exclusively of Knights of the Realm, usually those from with particularly influential or wealthy fiefs, as a battle trained pegasus is a highly expensive and prestigious mount. That said, a pegasus is no mere status symbol, for they are stronger and faster than even the finest Destrier and their ability to take flight with a knight upon their back makes them incredibly useful in war. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation.

Few indeed reach this pinnacle of virtue and only those with a pure an unblemished soul survive the experience, with those with even the slightest blemish to their honour are merely granted peaceful death. From that moment on the knight takes up a new vow, to serve the Lady and the Grail, and becomes something more than a mortal man. Grail Knights are sworn to defend the sacred places of the Lady, be they chapels, lakes, or simple woodland groves, and they will only leave these sites to take up war when the wider realm is truly threatened. To the commonfolk of Bretonnia the Grail Knights form a pantheon of living deities, an impossibly perfect ideal which uplifts and gives purpose to their life simply by existing, and long after a Grail Knight falls in battle his name will be remembered by the peasantry and repeated like a prayer against evil. Bretonnian knights are provided with fine arms and armour by their family holdings, many passed down for generations, and as such put little burden for precious resources on the nation.

#descr "The commonfolk of Bretonnia have very few rights and many of the circumstances of their lives are dictated by what they are forbidden to do, as these acitvities are reserved as privileges of the nobility. Peasants may not wear bright colours, live in houses with more than two floors, or even travel freely beyond their village without explicit permission from the ruler of their fief. The exception to the law of travel comes in the case of a pilgrimage, as none can be denied the right to travel to a chapel or other sacred place of the Lady to seek her blessing. As such pilgrimages are popular even with less religious sorts, although almost inevitably many of those who engage in them find their faith greatly increased by both their company and the holy sites they witness. Occasionally pilgrims will be so taken with religious fervour that they seek the chance to take vengeance on the enemies of the Lady. They make poor fighters and because of the strict rules around pilgrimage are armed only with walking sticks and a handful of stones, but their fanaticism lends them courage in battle, though making them rather difficult to control. Pilgrims will gather at temples, particularly those within strong dominion, and await an army to join."

They are aware that by doing so they risk the deserved wrath of the nobility, ostracision from their fellow commoners, and gruesome death on the field of battle, but so strong is their hatred of those who would dare stand against the Lady and harm the defenders of Bretonnia that they can see no other path. Some Battle Pilgrims were once pilgrims who found a taste for war, others are the survivors of villages destroyed by marauders, and others still are those who saw knights heroically fighting to defend the realm and were overcome by religious rapture. These men are usually the veterans of many battles, for those who are unworthy are quickly slain, and make surprisingly effective infantry. The knights of Bretonnia regard Battle Pilgrims with a mixture of scorn and revulsion, but it is clear that the Lady has some plan for them, for her advocates not only tolerate them to exist but are known to bless them as sacred warriors."

While knights are supposed to seek glory and demonstrate valour, they are also expected to be men of eloquence and refinement in high social circles, and it is in this realm that the Courtiers hold the most sway. These nobles are disdained by their martial brethren but feared for their influence and skill in politicking and talent for inflicting public humiliation on any noble who tries to shame them for their lack of battle honours.

#descr "All Bretonnian Lords bear a greater responsibility than the Knights of the Realm who swear fealty to them, for their holdings consist of many fiefs and the lives of other nobles, not just commonfolk, are in their hands. Even so they are knights themselves and no-one, not even the King, can deny a knight his destiny. So it is that some Lords, even rulers of many decades, may receive a vision from the Lady, set aside their duties, and take the Questing Vow. Questing Knights are expected to live on the road and forego most of the luxuries of nobility and as such require only a quarter of the usual upkeep."

Grail Lords are amongst the greatest warriors of mankind, equalled in might only by servants of the Chaos gods. As with other knights they provide their own arms and armour and ride upon purebreed Destriers that are easily able to convey a heavily armoured rider."

This is no easy feat, for even a Grail Knight will find their skill, determination, and courage put to the test by such a foul tempered and deadly beast. Hippogryphs are winged hybrid creatures very similar to Griffons but have the hindquarters of a horse rather than a predatory cat. They make truly excellent mounts as they are both terrifying and powerful, capable of hurtling down from above to tear through entire enemy regiments with ease."

Just as the knights swear fealty to their Lord, the Lords swear fealty to their Duke, and the Dukes swear fealty to the King, the one among them picked to rule over all of Bretonnia at the behest of the Lady. Each of the Dukes is a mighty hero, having ascended to their position not only by birthright but by countless great and honourable deeds, and many of them have successfully completed the Questing Vow and become Grail Lords, taking back their title to protect all of the sacred sites within their Dukedom. By honouring their acheivements with a tournament, great hunt, feast day, or other ritual, one of the Dukes will be entreated to join your cause along with some troops.

[When you hire this commander you will receive, at the end of the turn, a randomly selected one of 12 unique Dukes which vary in power but are all stronger than a Lord commander. You will also receive assorted troops depending on which Duke you get. If you have already had all 12 Dukes, you'll get a Grail Lord and some troops instead. This can only happen if you still control the province in which the Duke was recruited, so if you are put under siege the Entreat Duke icon will remain until the province is back under your control, at which point you will get a Duke and troops as normal.]"

Bohemond's fame is hard to overstate: he is worshipped by the peasantry as a living god and held up as an ideal of the Questing Vow by almost every knight in the Kingdom. His greatest acheivement, for which he was granted the prize of the Grail, was the slaying of the dragon Smearghus, from whose bones he crafted his signature mace and whose scales were used to forge his armour. Bohemond, for all his martial prowess, has never been much of a leader of men, though his fame certainly inspires great deeds from those under his command."

Huebald is both small and slight by the standards of knights and has had to work extremely diligently to prove himself as a warrior, living a rather spartan life of training both his sword arm and his mind to better lead his Dukedom to military victory. Unlike some other Dukes Huebald never felt the call of the Questing Vow, for he was always too busy preparing for Carcassonne's next campaign against greenskins, beastmen and the like. He is known as a superb leader of men particularly favoured by the peasantry, for while he shows them no more compassion than most, he recognises their utility on the battlefield and is loathe to misuse any tactical asset. Huebald is brutally honest about his own strengths and weaknesses and eschews the use of a lance, as he does not regard his best place as being at the head of a charging formation of knights."

What is known is that when he returned he won the great Tournament of Couronne and as his prize claimed the honour of carrying the sacred Banner of Bretonnia. This banner contains magic which protects the entire allied force from cowardly missile fire in battle.

#fixedname "Alberic"
#descr "Alberic is the Duke of Bordeleaux, a powerful Dukedom famed for its wine, craftsmen, and large sea-ports. Dukes of Bordeleaux follow the Virtue of Discipline and are known to be sharp-minded and pragmatic rulers, often closely advising the King himself. Alberic is a highly capable commander and particularly well known for both the quality of his Knights of the Realm and his clever use of Yeoman soldiers, drawing on the comparatively better off commonfolk of his wealthy Dukedom. He believes strongly in the cause of Bretonnia and will donate gold from his personal coffers each month to support the war effort. In battle the Duke wields the magical Trident of Manann, which grants both him and a small force of troops the ability to travel underwater."

#descr "Folcard is the Duke of Montfort, a mountainous Dukedom that lies in the border with the Empire and is often embroiled in war and greenskin incursions. Dukes of Montfort follow the Virtue of Empathy, championing the commonfolk and receiving their loyalty and adoration in return. Folcard is perhaps the most beloved ruler in Bretonnia, at least amongst his own subjects, for he takes the practice of knightly compassion and empathy for lessers far more seriously than most of his fellow nobles. He cares deeply about the plight of his people and has even set up a system of signal beacons such that knights can quickly respond to threats to even remote villages. Folcard is well known for his ability to quickly organise provincial defences and the loyalty and comparative bravery displayed by commoners under his command."

Dukes of Quenelles follow the Virtue of Purity and are known for their honour and steadfast efforts to destroy the enemies of mankind. Tancred II is the son of one of the most revered Dukes and Grail Knights in Bretonnian history who lost his life at the hands of Heinrich Kemmler, the Lichemaster. Seeking to honour his father Tancred II swore to drive both the undead and greenskin blights from all Bretonnian lands and has led many campaigns to that goal. A highly skilled and honourable warrior in his own right, Tancred II followed in his father's footsteps by seeking and drinking from the Grail and also recovered the mighty magic weapon the Star of Quenelles, with which he smites evil from the world."

Consequently some women who seek freedom and find they have a talent for war effectively become mercenaries, though they must maintain the charade that they are merely tending to sheep. This suits the nobility rather well as while they are forbidden from hiring mercenaries, they are quite within their rights to hire Shepherdesses to escort a single sheep right to the site of a battle and through enemy lines. When a Shepherdess Commander is recruited she will bring fifteen of her Shepherdess 'assistants' with her.

#name "Battle Reliquae"
#descr "To some peasants Grail Knights are effectively living gods whose every act is one of divine heroism and every word is scripture, thus it is unsurpising that there is a particular set of Pilgrims who dedicate their lives to following Grail Knights and, should they meet their end, rushing to secure holy 'relics'. If a Grail Knight is unlucky to be felled in a remote place and this news reaches these fanatics before any members of the nobility, it is quite possible the remains of both knight and steed will be stolen away and turned into a Battle Reliquae. Battle Reliquaes are effectively the skeletal remains of a Grail Knight and his trusty steed dressed up and held together by bindings and staves in a parody of life. They are carried into battle by devout bands of Pilgrims who are driven into a frenzy by visions of their fallen hero-god looking over their actions and approving. Inevitably the presence of a Reliquae causes unrest in the population of a province as commoners argue over the wishes and possession of the remains. The nobility, especially those who have taken the Grail Vow, regard Reliquaes with disgust bordering on horror, but the emissaries of the Lady have let it be known that they are to be allowed to accompany armies into battle and the nobility have no choice but to accept their presence with gritted teeth.

It is not unheard of for even peasant girls to be selected as Maidens, a fact which somewhat salves the displeasure a farmer or labourer will feel at the news his newborn child is not a son."

#name "Green Knight"
#descr "The Green Knight is the sacred protector of Bretonnia, and his spirit-essence is intertwined with the land and the Lady of the Lake. As the Champion of the Lady he has tested many Questing Knights, facing them in duels to assess their worth to sip from the Grail, sometimes even slaying those who are truly unworthy of this final test. Amongst evil creatures like Beastmen and Greenskins the Green Knight is greatly feared, for he is a merciless and relentless slayer of such filth, capable of bursting forth from the bole of ancient trees, springing from still lakes, or galloping out from behind waterfalls to wreak his terrible vengeance against interlopers to the realm of the Lady. Bretonnians dare not ascribe a name to this figure but in the foul tongue of the Beastmen he is known as 'Shaabhekh', or Soul Killer. Weapons have little effect on the Green Knight. Some say that blades and arrows pass straight through him as though he were as insubstantial as morning mist, while in other stories, even the most grievous of wounds inflicted upon him have virtually no effect. In one epic tale, a Questing Knight cut the Green Knight's head clean from his shoulders, but the fey being simply picked up his head and rode away. What the Green Knight actually is has been much debated, and no one in Bretonnia, save perhaps the Fay Enchantress, knows the truth. Some believe that he is the spirit of Bretonnia given physical form, while others whisper that he is Gilles le Breton himself, having devoted himself completely to the land and the Lady after he was taken from this world. Many times the Green Knight has disappeared, often after falling in battle, only to reappear some time later, for as long as Bretonnia stands she will have her protector."

#name "Fay Enchantress"
#descr "A figure of awe and inspiration, the Fay Enchantress is the personal representative of the Lady of the Lake and as such is the most influential figure in Bretonnia. All Grail Knights are sworn to her service and even Kings must bow to her commands. The Fay Enchantress personally takes the noble daughters who become Damsels and Prophetesses and in cases where there is no clear successor, will select the new monarch. The current Enchantress is known as Morgiana and while there have been Enchantresses before her, in truth there is but a single spirit reincarnated in a different body the moment her previous form perishes. The Enchantress is a being of incredible magical ability, stunning beauty, and sudden spite, making her one of the most terrifyingly powerful beings in the known world. On the relatively rare occasions she takes to the battlefield she does so atop a mighty Unicorn 'Silvaron', perhaps the noblest of its kind outside of Athel Loren. The Enchantress carries the fabled Chalice of Potions which allows her to cast spells at a faster rate than mortal mages, wears the Girdle of Gold which protects her from harm, and is accompanied by a magical toad from which she can draw arcane power, said to be a former noble who greatly displeased her."

#descr "The King of Bretonnia is the highest authority within the feudal order, a position accountable only to the highest emissaries of the Lady, such as the Fay Enchantress. Kings are almost always selected from amongst the ranks of the Dukes or the direct male heir of the former King, though it is not unknown for a particularly heroic noble to be chosen by the Fay Enchantress, whose word is absolute. The current King of Bretonnia is Louen Leoncoeur, also Duke of Couronne, a heroic leader regarded as the greatest since Gilles the Uniter himself. Louen's bravery, honour, and talent for diplomacy are famed across the Old World and it is whispered that he not only drank from the Grail but was granted a kiss by the Lady of the Lake. Certainly he seems to benefit from blessings even greater than those of other Grail Lords, as he is able to heal from nearly any wound and is surrounded by an even more powerful aura of splendor. Louen rides into battle atop his ferocious Hippogryph 'Beaquis', an especially loyal and powerful example of its kind, and is armed with the ancestral Sword of Couronne and the Lion's Shield, which grants him incredible resistance to hostile magic. On his brow rests the Crown of Bretonnia, worn by every King since Gilles the Uniter, which inspires those under his command to great deeds."

#descr "Repanse de Lyonesse was once a humble shepherdess, though one of notably devout faith in the Lady. Her village was attacked and laid waste by Chaos raiders split off from a great horde besieging Couronne and when Repanse returned from the pastures she found nothing but ruin and death. At this dark moment she received a vision from the Lady telling her to take up arms and rid her land of these interlopers so she donned the armour from a fallen knight, took an ancient blade from the reliquary of the wrecked Grail Chapel, and fastened a tapestry bearing the Fleur de Lys to a lance. When the wounded and scattered knights saw a single Damsel setting out to fight the forces of Chaos they felt shamed and honour bound to follow her to death or glory. Since that time Repanse has become one of the greatest heroes of Bretonnia and has consistently shown the favour of the Lady. She is surrounded in battle by an dazzling aura of light and both her sword and makeshift banner offer protection from hostile magic to her and any who follow.

Like the other knights of Repanse's army, he placed himself in her service in recognition of her strong association with the Lady of the Lake. Having received the blessing of the Grail the already mighty knight augmented his great physical strength with supernatural prowess and in service of the Damsel of War Repanse de Lyonesse he has proved himself to be one of the greatest warriors the world has ever seen. Henri wields a magical sword enchanted to slay great beasts, protects himself with a shield blessed to repel cowardly projectile attacks, and wears thick plate armour. Henri is an imposing figure and an inspiration to others, but has little interest in military leadership, leaving this to Repanse and her advisors."

#name "Black Knight"
#descr "Mallobaude, often called the Black Knight, is the first Bretonnian in generations to present a serious chance of returning the lost and cursed Dukedom of Mousillon to proper rule. Mallobaude's career as a knight thusfar has been spectacular; as a Knight Errant he won glory leading a group in the Border Princes, swiftly became a Knight of the Realm and immediately took the Questing Vow. Despite many victories over foul creatures and countless heroic deeds, Mallobaude did not receive a vision of the Grail and began to despair that he had somehow lost his way. He realised he had been pursuing greatness for its own sake and, as penance, rode alone to Mousillon to face the suicidal task of cleansing that land. What happened there is unclear, but after many battles Mallobaude emerged carrying the banner of Mousillon and announced he would soon be known as its Duke, drawing many knights to support him in this crusade. While Mallobaude is a highly impressive, his association with Mousillon, unusual outcome of his Questing Vow, and rumours that he is the illegitimate son of King Louen have cast something of a shadow over his status. Indeed it is whispered amongst the peasantry that even the emissaries of the Lady are not keen to meet his piercing gaze, though no nobles would publicly countenance such nonsense."

#msg "Welcome! Bretonnia has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:

Noble Vows. Your Paladins and Lords have a chance each turn to take up the Questing Vow, becoming a Questing Paladin/Lord. Questing Paladins/Lords then have a chance each turn to find the Grail and become a much more powerful Grail Paladin/Lord.

Questing Knights. The smallfolk of Bretonnia are often beset by raiders and fouls beasts, but many Questing Knights travel your lands. Each turn an unforted province you control within your dominion may lose some tax income that turn and gain some unrest, but in return you get one or more Questing Knights.

Pilgrims of the Lady. Each of your temmples represents a Grail Chapel dedicated to worship of the Lady. Pilgrims to these locations are common and occasionally they will be inspired to join your forces. The stronger your dominion in the province the more likely it is that a group of Pilgrims or Battle Pilgrims will spawn. Pilgrims are quite weak but numerous, while the less commmon Battle Pilgrims are sacred and of higher quality. This will happen silently, without triggering any message."

#brief "Bretonnia is a feudal kingdom of peasants ruled over by a warrior class of knights at the behest of mysterious and magically powerful Grail Damsels."
#descr "Bretonnia, like the Empire, was once a land where primitive human tribes fought over resources and lived in fear of Greenskins and monsters. This changed when the Bretonni tribe were blessed by the attentions of the mysterious Lady of the Lake who granted guiding visions the power of a holy Grail to a noble by the name of Gilles. Gilles gathered a group of knights known as the Grail Companions at his side and together they united the humans east of the Grey Mountains and forged a nation, defeating countless enemies of man. With the help of emissaries of the Lady the nation of Bretonnia established a strict social hierarchy of peasants sworn to obey a warrior class of peerless knights who in turn swore fealty to Lords, who served Dukes, who served the King. Bretonnia is a superstitious land with largely illiterate commonfolk and is somewhat mistrustful of outsiders, but produces excellent mounted warriors and can rely on both a devout population and the assistance of magically powerful Grail Damsels who serve the Lady."
#summary "Race: Humans
Military: Expendable peasants, powerful heavy cavalry including flying pegasus knights and sacred Grail Knights. Cannot recruit mercenaries
Magic: Nature, Water, and Air with minor Astral and Earth

Still, Warriors are invaluable as it is they who venture forth to conquer and enslave, feeding the endless hunger of their society for disposable labour. Like all Dwarfs they are hardy and resolute fighters unlikely to suffer the dishonour of fleeing, and very well armed and armoured.

#descr "The Chaos Dwarfs have created a great many weapons of war, with most being as cruel and dangerous as their makers. The best known of these and most widely used amongst their kind is the blunderbuss, a vicious device capable of belching forth a hail of stone or metal shards. The exact alchemical formula used to create the explosive black tar used to propel this flesh-shredding shrapnel is a closely guarded secret, though the Chaos Dwarfs have been known to sell barrels of it to ogre warbands in exchange for slaves. The blunderbuss is best used against packed formations of lesser enemies, particularly those that lack shields or decent armour, as it is neither accurate nor long ranged. Unlike the archers of weaker nations, the Chaos Dwarfs entrusted with these weapons are well armoured and capable melee fighters. Chaos Dwarfs are resistant to magic, but not to the extent of their Western cousins, though they are equally disciplined and tireless marchers."

#descr "The crossbow is a traditional weapon of war for all dwarfs, and the Chaos Dwarfs are no exception in this regard. No matter what hideously destructive devices the Daemonsmiths, metalworkers, or alchemists create in the hellish forges of Zharr Naggrund, none will ever truly replace the crossbow. Much like their cousins to the west the children of Hashut regard the crossbows made by lesser races with contempt, for theirs are of considerably better craftsmanship and can propel heavier bolts just as far. Chaos Dwarf crossbowmen wear slightly lighter armour than their comrades and favour traditional hats with more fabric and less iron, as they are more likely to have to stand watch over slaves for prolonged periods and as such do make certain concessions to comfort. Chaos Dwarfs are resistant to magic, but not to the extent of their Western cousins, though they are equally disciplined and tireless marchers."

#descr "Hobgoblins are a subrace of greenskins closely related to the more widespread orcs and goblins. Though not nearly so strong, tough, or aggressive as orcs, they are larger and stronger than goblins and make better fighters. In terms of mindset they are far closer to goblins than orcs, though arguably even sneakier and less trustworthy. Centuries ago the Chaos Dwarfs faced the largest slave uprising in their history and stood on the brink of defeat at the hands of a massive greenskin force which had taken most of Zharr-Naggrund, but at the last moment the hobgoblins, fearing the cruelty of the Chaos Dwarfs more than the brutality of the orcs, switched sides. Since that time the Hobgoblins have been cast out of greenskin society and, while they have risen from the position of slaves to menial servants, they are almost entirely reliant on the protection of their masters. Hobgoblins favour a cautious fighting style, using spears or bows to keep their foe at bay, or launching sneak attacks when their target isn't looking."

#descr "Hobgoblins are a subrace of greenskins closely related to the more widespread orcs and goblins. Though not nearly so strong, tough, or aggressive as orcs, they are larger and stronger than goblins and make better fighters. In terms of mindset they are far closer to goblins than orcs, though arguably even sneakier and less trustworthy. Centuries ago the Chaos Dwarfs faced the largest slave uprising in their history and stood on the brink of defeat at the hands of a massive greenskin force which had taken most of Zharr-Naggrund, but at the last moment the hobgoblins, fearing the cruelty of the Chaos Dwarfs more than the brutality of the orcs, switched sides. Since that time the Hobgoblins have been cast out of greenskin society and, while they have risen from the position of slaves to menial servants, they are almost entirely reliant on the protection of their masters. Hobgoblins favour a cautious fighting style, using spears or bows to keep their foe at bay, or launching sneak attacks when their target isn't looking."

Because humans can be manipulated by threatening their comrades and respond more readily to the looming spectre of being tortured or sent to the mines they are particular favoured by traders, scribes, and other civilians who lack the strength or resources to keep greenskins in line. They are also regarded by the Cult of Hashut as making for superior sacrifices in certain rituals. As such it is only truly miserable humans that are sent to die in battle; those that are lame, incapable, or too troublesome to manage. These wretches are given crude spears and simply shoved forward amongst the greenskin rabble to die."

Even compared with goblins they are physically weak, though they do boast better reactions and are even more capable of somehow smuggling sharp objects on their person; indeed their owners rarely even bother taking these away, as Gnoblars will always find or make another shank. They also have a nasty habit of collecting and hurling small pieces of sharp scrap and rocks with a reasonable degree of accuracy. Gnoblars don't make particularly good labourers, but a slave is a slave, and ogre tribes will usually trade them over in exchange for relatively little of value to the Chaos Dwarfs."

Orcs are heavily muscled creatures with thick bones and small brains who respect nothing more than power and like little more than to fight, even with each other. Even having been enslaved, orcs are still willing combatants, much preferring to meet their end in combat rather than in some mining accident. Orc physiology is unusual in that over time they can recover from almost any wound, even growing back missing limbs. This orc slave is fresh from the mines and still carries a pickaxe which makes a reasonable improvised weapon."

The Immortals receive extensive additional training and are outfitted with incredibly ornate gold and black steel plate armour, thick shields, and superbly smithed weaponry. So prepared, they act as an elite guard to the Sorcerer Lords, assigned according to a vote by the conclave of the Great Temple of Hashut, typically to Sorcerer Lords who have recently done great service to the Cult, or hold particular power at the time. The Immortals are forbidden to show fear to the enemy and the faces of their helms are handcrafted as placid golden visages of the Dwarf beneath, calmly regarding the carnage of the battlefield at all times. The Immortals are partially funded by a tithe taken from all Sorcerer Lords and has such have decreased upkeep.

The Acolytes are skilled enough with their glaives but lack the heavy armour typical amongst the legions and are best protected from prolonged melee.

In terms of mindset they are far closer to goblins than orcs, though arguably even sneakier and less trustworthy. Centuries ago the Chaos Dwarfs faced the largest slave uprising in their history and stood on the brink of defeat at the hands of a massive greenskin force which had taken most of Zharr-Naggrund, but at the last moment the hobgoblins, fearing the cruelty of the Chaos Dwarfs more than the brutality of the orcs, switched sides. Since that time the Hobgoblins have been cast out of greenskin society and, while they have risen from the position of slaves to menial servants, they are almost entirely reliant on the protection of their masters. A naturally sneaky race, Hobgoblins make fine scouts."

They are ruled over by Khans, Hobgoblins sufficiently paranoid and treacherous to rise to the top of a tribe and survive enough betrayals to solidify power, at least for now. All Khans wear crowns of iron and in theory serve the Great Hobgobla Khan, ruler of all their kind and the only chieftain permitted to wear a crown of gold.

The warriors of this tribe fight in battle with two long curving knives treated with all manner of poisons and ideally suited to their back stabbing methods. The gutstabbers, as the very sneakiest assassins of this tribe are known, are duplicitous and cruel even by the standards of their fellows. Any Sneaky Git will happily place a dagger in the back of a foe or rival, but the gutstabbers are so sly that they're prone to stab a perceived enemy in the front, right in the gut! The Chaos Dwarfs use these murderous greenskins as assassins, sending them out against tribal leaders, or letting them pick their targets and kill seemingly at random just to put fear into their own slaves.

#descr "Without slaves the empire of the Chaos Dwarfs could not function; they are used extensively in every strata of society for every purpose imaginable, from ritual sacrifice, to administration, to labour, to military fodder. Yet despite this reliance on slaves, those who perform the role of buying, selling, and breaking slaves are considered to be uncivilised and are exempt from many of the social circles and rites so important to the clans. Though there is no slaver caste, slavers tend to live rather alienated lives and their offspring are unlikely to become more than slavers themselves. Typically they are not true citizens of Zharr-Naggrund, but were born and raised in one of the many lesser outposts maintained by the empire. Wearing masked helms made from the skulls of ogres and with bone fetishes in their beards, they are a greatly feared sight to any slave, for their eyes and ears are as sharp as the spines on their whips and they are always seeking to punish the slightest sign of dissent. Slavers contribute to the productivity of any fort in the province and allow the purchase of slave contracts outside forts. The presence of a Slaver in any province will undoubtedly also result in particularly unruly slaves being handed over for free to die in battle.

Castellans are members of the Warrior caste who have distinguished themselves over and over again in battle under the watchful eye of an Overlord, who in turn serves a Sorcerer Lord.

#descr "Deathmasks are members of the Infernal Guard who have, through suicidal bravery in combat, earned the right to have their helm removed. The process of removing the helm is nearly as painful as the process of sealing the dishonoured dwarf in his armour, for his flesh is usually fused with the metal. Many do not survive, but for the Infernal Guard this is their only hope. Upon being unsealed they are given a new identity and while they can never leave the Infernal Guard or undo their dishonour entirely, they are recognised once more as having a status equivalent to that of a member of the lowest caste of Chaos Dwarf. Deathmasks lead their fellows into battle, utilising their considerable tactical experience and seeking to inspire them with the hope of going through the unsealing process and becoming dwarfs once more. In normal life, or what passes for it amongst the Infernal Guard, the Deathmasks proudly display their scarred faces, while in battle they once more don their full helmet. Members of the Infernal Guard can only be recruited when a Daemonsmith is present.

#descr "Bull Centaurs are creatures with the upper torso of a Chaos Dwarf but the body of a ferocious bull. Many centuries ago, when their kind was first twisted by Chaos, some Chaos Dwarfs were transformed into Bull Centaurs, creating a revered subrace of fast moving warriors. Since those days the Bull Centaurs have guarded the great temples of Hashut and the central Tower of Zharr-Naggrund. The eldest of the Bull Centaurs, known as Ancients, have been blessed with a lifespan beyond those of their fellows and are marked as the chosen of Hashut, his will made manifest. They consider themselves executioners of sorts and proudly display trophy skulls of slave revolt leaders, dangerous ogres, or disloyal Chaos Dwarfs. Even beneath their finely crafted armour their hide is extremely tough, and they have been gifted considerable resistance to fire through their zealous worship of Hashut. Though they could easily trample smaller foes underhoof they instead prefer to strike with their huge crescent axes and have even been known to grab foes and impale them on their prodigious tusks or horns."

#descr "Daemonsmiths are members of the Cult of Hashut who showed talent for binding and controlling demonic essence at an early age. These young dwarfs are taken out of the training which results in Acolytes, Pyrophants, and members of the Sorcerous caste, and instead sent to learn in the secret forges deep below Zharr-Naggrund. The order of Daemonsmiths guard their techniques jealously even from the Sorcerers, and their talents are integral to the advancement of the Chaos Dwarf race. It is the Daemonsmiths who create and maintain the great daemonic machinery which delivers steam power across the capital, it is they who oversee the forging of arms and armour, and it is they alone who can create, apply, and enchant Infernal armour. Indeed, without them there would be no Infernal Guard at all. Daemonsmiths are excellent at forging magical items but are inefficient researchers or battle mages and while members of the Cult of Hashut they have received no priestly training. Each Daemonsmith increases the resources available when present at a fort and allows the recruitment of Infernal Guard."

The lowest level of ordained priest within the Cult is the Pyrophant, and these dwarfs make up the majority of the priesthood. They are tasked with making the routine observances to Hashut, delivering his blessings to the warrior acolytes, performing various tasks considered beneath sorcerers, and most importantly conducting research into the arts of fire and darkness. Sorcerers and Sorcerer Lords, though far more skilled in magic, rarely wish to devote their time to research, for their primary focus at all times must be manoeuvring to maintain or extend their grasp of power. Particularly skilled Pyrophants may also be deployed to support the legions with lesser evocations, though they cannot be expected to match the destructive arcane power of true Sorcerers. They carry bull headed scepters which signify their position as chosen children of Hashut."

#descr "Any Chaos Dwarf that shows aptitude for magic, however weak, is taken from his clan and inducted into the Cult of Hashut. Those rare Dwarfs whose magical abilities quickly outstrip those of their fellows eventually form the upper echelon of the Cult; they are the Sorcerers, and it is their place to rule all of Chaos Dwarf society. Each Sorcerer is, in addition to his considerable magical prowess in the arts of shadow, fire, magma, ash, and blood, also invested with considerable priestly authority and political power, though they leave the leadership of the Legions to the Castellans and the Overlords that serve the most powerful of their caste. This Sorcerer has almost entirely succumbed to the Stone Curse, losing all but one of his limbs to the spreading stone and seeing his magical powers quickly decline. The Stone Curse is known for its rapid acceleration, so it will not be long before this mage joins his ancestors as a lifeless statue. Should the mage be slain one of his guards will carry away the body while the other fights on for the duration of the battle before ending his life in shame.

#descr "Perhaps the greatest amongst the Bull Centaur Ancients, Shar'Tor is known as the Executioner, for he is the favoured headsman of Hashut. It is said that he has never failed to bring judgement to a marked foe of the Chaos Dwarfs dark god and his mere presence spreads the dominion of Hashut, though he preaches not a single word. Indeed Shar'Tor lets not a single syllable pass from gilded mask that hides his visage until he is in battle with the foe, at which point he calls out the will of Hashut with such force that the weak of heart simply drop dead in front of him. Shar'Tor wields the Darktide Axe, a cruel weapon steeped in untold years of slaughter upon which burn runes of hate and malice."

#name "Hobgoblin Chieftain"
#descr "All Hobgoblins are sneaky, conniving, cowardly, and treacherous, and Gorduz Backstabba is perhaps the most self-serving of the lot. Gorduz embodies all the vices and virtues that make Hobgoblins what they are and as such has been extremely succesful, rising to the position of the most powerful Chieftain within the realm of the Chaos Dwarfs. Unlike the Khans of the East who have a more independent spirit, Gorduz has lived his life under the harsh rule of Chaos Dwarfs and has been careful to not only avoid their wrath but cleverly and strategically displace it onto others of his kind. In addition to his considerable and ruthless cunning it must be noted that Gorduz has proven, for whatever reason, almost impossible to kill. In fact numerous times he has been reported slain, usually having been betrayed by one or more other Hobgoblins, only to re-appear some time later to enact bloody revenge."

#name "High Priest of Hashut"
#descr "Astragoth is the oldest living Chaos Dwarf Sorcerer and the current High Priest of Hashut, placing him squarely at the top of the pyramid that is Chaos Dwarf society. At the height of his powers he was the most potent sorcerer to walk the Plain of Zharr in a thousand years, feared by his foes and respected by all. In recent decades his powers have waned and the Stone Curse has begun to wreak its terrible damage, turning all of his limbs to stone. Though none would openly admit it this was cause for joy amongst his many rivals, especially those with a chance to ascend to the position of High Priest, but to their dismay Astragoth has, seemingly through sheer will, temporarily halted his petrification. Seemingly to spite those predicting his immiment downfall, the High Priest has fashioned magical machinery to replace the function of his limbs and taken to the field with renewed vigour. His mechanical limbs grant him great strength, durability, and mobility."

Working with Daemonsmiths to forge and empower two suits of bronze armour dipped in the blood of sacrifices to Hashut, the Sorcerer can then channel both lava and otherworldy Daemonic matter into the vessel to create a pair of Kdaai Fireborn"

---------------- WELCOME TO CHAOS DWARFS -----------------

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! The Chaos Dwarfs mod has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:

Enslavement. When you conquer a province with a commander and 15+ troops and the province population is > 2000, some of the population are enslaved and sent to one of your forts, granting resources, gold, population, and battle slaves. With 20+ troops there is an event for population > 4000 and with 25+ an event for population > 6000. Each size of event can trigger 3 times each turn, for a total of 9 possible Enslavement events.

Stone Curse. Each Sorcerer and Sorcerer Lord has a chance each turn (3% and 5% respectively) to become afflicted with the Stone Curse. The Curse starts by turning their legs to stone, removing their foot slot. They will be carried by guards and won't be immobile, but each turn there's a 15% chance the curse worsens, removing their body slot and a hand slot. Then there is a 33% chance it turns them entirely into a statue, killing Sorcerers and turning Sorcerer Lords into a H3 priest with no magic.

Slavers. Each province with population above 2000 and unrest below 20 will produce 1d3 slaves if a Slaver is present. Stacking Slavers does not produce more slaves.

Fort Pollution. Chaos Dwarfs pollute any province where they own or are sieging a fort, pushing the local Death scale towards 1 if the province has neutral or positive Growth."

#end

-------- Slaver is present so passive slave generation

-- Slaves if unrest is low enough and enough people present

#end


---------------- SLAVING EVENTS ----------------------

--- an alternative solution to this is using PD. Give everyone an event that always grants 1 PD to all 0 PD provinces. Then check which province has 0 PD. That will tell you it was just conquered.


----- The basic idea here is that when a province is conquered by Chaos Dwarfs if it is above 2k, 4k, or 6k in pop and the Chaos Dwarf force meets some basic criteria it gets a corresponding flag. There can only be 3 flags for each size, per turn. Any more conquering than that doesn't trigger the slaving events.
----- Each turn three of these flags for each type (pop size) are processed, sending a reward to the chaos dwarf capital (and ONLY the capital). These events have to be delay 0, because they need to definitely fire after flags are placed.

----- ADD A FLAG MONSTER signifying that Chaos Dwarfs conquered this province if it is owned by Chaos Dwarfs and does not contain a 'Chaos Dwarfs' site if it has over a certain population
------- ALSO kill a chunk of population, commensurate with size
------- plus adds the 'Chaos Dwarfs' site
------- REQUIRES at least 20 friendly troops to be present AND requires a non sneaking commander

------ 6kA conquest

#brief "Long ago before the Time of Chaos the golden empire of the Dwarfs spread far to the East. As the tides of Chaos swallowed the world the Dwarfs assumed their Eastern brothers slain, but they were not. Abandoned by their brothers and their gods, they survived, but changed. Greed was amplified, pride became arrogance, tradition was replaced with dogma, loyalty turned to zealotry, and stoicism changed to cruelty. So were the Chaos Dwarfs birthed, a harsh people in a harsh land."

As the tides of Chaos swallowed the world the Dwarfs assumed their Eastern brothers slain, but they were not. Abandoned by their brothers and their gods, they survived, but changed. Greed was amplified, pride became arrogance, tradition was replaced with dogma, loyalty turned to zealotry, and stoicism changed to cruelty. So were the Chaos Dwarfs birthed, a harsh people in a harsh land. Now with the coming of the Awakening God the forges of war have been stoked to unceasing fire, the legions of Zharr-Naggrund march forth in lockstep, and the world trembles."
#summary "Race: Evil dwarfs. Death scales do not reduce supply and have half impact on income.
Military: Heavy dwarf infantry, bull centaur sacred cavalry, throngs of expendable slaves, and sneaky hobgoblin servants.
Magic: Strong Fire and Earth, with Blood and Death. Sorcerers can succumb to Stone Curse.
Priests: Powerful.
Mechanics: Armies enslave as they conquer. Owning or sieging a fort pollutes the province towards Death 1 if it has neutral or positive growth."

The older, more experienced members of the core soldiery tend to join the ranks of the Dreadspears, regiments armed with spear and shield and dedicated to holding the line and protecting less well armoured units. Dreadspears tend to consider themselves true soldiers rather than arrogant warriors or crazed sadists, favouring discipline and a cold methodical slaughter of the foe before them. Though they cannot boast the incredibly well drilled and harmonised formations of their hated cousins the High Elves, Dreadspears nonetheless represent a bastion of bristling spearpoints that is near impossible for the rank and file of other forces to overwhelm."

Most are conscripted from the population of serve at the command of a powerful Master or Dreadlord, but some join seeking social advancement, or from a desire to prove themselves in bloody battle. Darkshards are named for their use of the deadly Naggarothi repeater crossbow, an advanced steel design capable of redrawing and firing from a rack of bolts far faster than a traditional crossbow. The Dark Elves see no dishonour in the use of ranged weapons and those in the Darkshards find the slaughter of foes from a distance just as sadistically satisfying as they would spilling blood with a blade up close. Typically having had decades of practice and blessed with the superior vision of their kind, every Darkshard is a frighteningly accurate marksman by the standards of other, lesser races."

Corsairs avoid the use of cumbersome, heavy armour or shields as it is entirely unsuited to battle in the rigging of a ship, a perilous boarding action, or a running fight across a dockside.

#name "Cold One Knight"
#descr "Cold One Knights count themselves amongst the finest warriors in Naggaroth and many cities and Black Arks pride themselves on how many of these deadly knights they can muster. They are nobles of ambition who seek to further their social standing through glory in battle rather than purely intrigue or courtly scheming and as such they are well respected and feared. The Cold Ones they have made their mounts are famously vicious and aggressive creatures and breaking them in requires considerable force of will. The Cold Ones of Naggaroth are related to the very similar beasts used as mounts by the Saurus of Lustria, but are swifter, lighter and without the ability to exude a substance which causes rapid healing. In fact these creatures from the caves under Hag Graef instead exude a noxious substance that can permanently ruin the senses of touch, smell, and taste that many decadent Dark Elves prize beyond all else, another demonstration of the discipline and single minded ambition of their riders. Should the knight fall in battle their mount can be relied upon to continue fighting for a time, though after battle they will quickly escape."

For some it is simply that their exposure to the noxious slime of the Cold Ones has entirely destroyed their finer senses and they can now find only sadistic joy in the bloody chaos of war, for others they seek to reach the position of Dreadlord through martial glory, while others still are biding their time in the knowledge that their enemies within Dark Elf society still hold power and would end their lives if they rose too high. Dreadknights are treated with considerable respect, bordering on reverence, by most Dark Elf warriors, for they represent an ideal of ambition, superiority, discipline, and martial skill. Dreadknights have access to the best arms and armour available, ride upon the finest Cold One steeds, and even armour their mounts in elaborately wrought overlapping plates. Should the knight fall in battle their mount can be relied upon to continue fighting for a time, though after battle they will quickly escape."

Their observances to the God of Murder are blood slicked affairs where the suffering of the victim and the sadistic glee of the Witch Elf are of paramount importance. Yet ceremonies are but part of the Witch Elves' worship, for the truest dedications to Khaine must take place on the battlefield that is his true domain. On the eve of war Witch Elves drink blood laced with secret herbs which grants them the ability to fly into a near uncontrolled frenzy when wounded or blessed, giving little thought to their own defence as they seek to cause the utmost slaughter in the name of their master. Witch Elves enter battle armed with paired blades dipped in poisonous oils and wear very little in the way of armour, as they are expected to offer their own bodies, blood, and suffering to Khaine willingly. Worship of Khaine is the state religion of the Dark Elves and Witch Elves are considered sacred."

#descr "Harpies are vile and sadistic creatures that make their nests in the uppermost spires of Karond Kar. Some claim that they are the souls of slain Witch Elves given physical form, others contend that they are a manifestation of Khaine's cruelty, while scholars tend to regard them as some form of Chaos tainted mutant elf. Whatever the truth of the matter, they are considered to be a good omen in Naggarothi lore and it is widely believed by the inhabitants of Karond Kar that should they ever leave the city would soon fall. Harpies are similar in temperament to Dark Elves in the sense that they love to torment their prey, but they lack any of the accompanying discipline or dark nobility. Physically they appear as a cross between a bestial Dark Elf and some foul scavenging bird with razor sharp talons. Despite their humanoid appearance they possess a mind only raised slightly above the level of an animal and have no concept of the use of tools, instead fighting unarmoured in great shrieking mobs that descend upon vulnerable foes. Unless wrangled and threatened by a Beastmaster they are unlikely to stick around in a tough battle, but are at least capable of following a basic battle plan through some instinctual understanding of how to coordinate with Dark Elf forces."

#descr "Har Ganeth is the spiritual centre of Khaine's worship, with many shrines to the God of Murder and a skyline dominated by the massive Great Temple of Khaine. It is from Har Ganeth that Hellebron rules over the Witch Elves and countless slaves are brought to the city to be sacrificed to Khaine. Many of these sacrifices are performed by the Witch Elves and Death Hags, but after particularly great victories Har Ganeth hosts ritual mass executions in which prisoners of war are decapitated and their heads cast down the steps of the Great Temple. These executions are performed by the feared Executioners of Har Ganeth, whose loyalty is to the city and to Khaine rather than the reigning Crone Hellebron. Executioners have embraced discipline and efficiency, seeing the excesses and cruelty of the Witch Elves as needless and indulgent; a poor tribute to the true will of the God of Murder. Each Executioner strides to battle well armoured, their face hidden behind a skull like visage, and armed with a long two handed blade known as a Draich, the ceremonial weapon of his calling. Each Draich is subtly different, tailored and refined to the exact skills and preferences of its wielder, but each is as deadly as the next in the hands of its master. While Executioners are truly devoted to Khaine their cold, efficient manner and distance from the rituals of the Witch Elves means they are not seen as sacred warriors of Khaine by the populace."

The training of the Black Guard is legendarily harsh, for in addition to constant training of body and mind they are set against each other from a young age and expected to kill their classmates in order to advance and prove themselves. Malekith himself is known to lavish favour on those who show great cunning and bloodlust and once their training is complete they swear to serve for a period of no less than two centuries. Those Black Guard who survive their tour of service inevitably go on to positions of power and influence and are permitted to restore their family bonds and bring considerable favour to their clan. In battle the Black Guard march in perfect lockstep, for those who have survived the training are truly brothers, and are equipped with fine armour and great polearms which they wield with terrifying skill. Their discipline and steadfastness is famed across the world and it is said that they would rather die than break ranks or show weakness, for they know the bale eye of Malekith is always upon them."

#descr "When Malekith first learned of the Prophecy of Demise, his wrath immediately fell upon the Warlocks of Hag Graef. Interpreting the prophecy as predicting the son of a noble house would defeat him with the use of sorcery, he knew he must allow no male practicioners of magic to live freely in Naggaroth and sought to strike before the Warlocks could rebel against his rule. At this time the Warlocks were known as a great power in the land and Malekith had still not consolidated his grip beyond the city of Naggarond, so rather than pursuing military conflict he went to his mother, Morathi, and her Sorceress Convents. The Sorceresses wove a great curse that coursed through the ranks of the Warlocks, inflicting them with spiritual hollowness and marking their souls like beacons for the attention of Slaanesh. While other Elves fear the grasp of Slaanesh as a potential fate, the Warlocks could feel the Dark Prince's hunger at every moment. Though many soon fell, consumed by unholy flames, the Warlocks adapted and learned they could stall their fate by reaping souls in their stead. Doomfire Warlocks now act as mounted raiders within the Dark Elf forces, descending upon vulnerable targets to harvest souls and extend their lives. Though those amongst them with the strongest magic were quickly devoured, those that remain are known to shroud themselves in hellish flames and even project them onto their foes. Marked out as the Warlocks are for Slaanesh's delictation, those attacking them may find their weapons supernaturally turned back against them."

Amongst those who fight voluntarily there is no group so famed or admired as the Sisters of Slaughter, originally a band of a mere dozen daughters of disgraced nobility who came together in the worship of Eldrazor, the God of Blades, that he might grant them glorious revenge. Now with their vengeance carved into the bones of those who brought their families low, the Sisters of Slaughter have thousands of members who fight at arenas across Naggaroth. Most Sisters spend their lives in gladiatorial combat in tribute to Eldrazor, but some see greater challenges lie on the battlefields of the world and join the forces of a fortunate Master or Dreadlord. In combat the Sisters wield barbed whips with impossible skill and grace, as they catch and deflect blows with bladed bucklers or simply dance through every attack their foe makes with mocking grace."

#descr "Dark Elves view all other races as inferior and fit only to be prey or toil as slaves. Dark Elves believe in committing to the pursuits of pleasure, martial glory, social status, and worship of Khaine, with all other activities considered below them, and as such their society has a constant need for slaves both economically and socially. From the doomed souls that toil deep in mines to the relatively well kept attendants of high society, from those that live only to perish in the gladiatorial arena to the countless numbers ritually sacrificed to Khaine, Dark Elf society runs on slaves. Slaves are also used in battle, driven before the Dark Elf force to absorb the impact of charges and soak up missile fire, or simply die in a way that amuses their masters. The slaves available to the military are typically those who aren't fit for other purposes and the quality will be mixed. Men from the Old World, Marauder tribesmen from the north, Goblins, and Orcs; some of them may even be slaves equipped specifically for war rather than plucked directly from the mines. Slaves are best led into battle by a Beastmaster, for Dark Elves make little distinction between animals and slaves. (If the province is attacked before they get a chance to turn into a random slave, you will get a human spear armed slave for the duration of that battle)"

#descr "Daemonettes are the most numerous of Slaanesh's servants. They are shrouded in a hypnotic glamour, seditious magics that bestow them a perverse beauty. Daemonettes surge across the battlefield on lithe legs, capering and dancing from foe to foe, claws slicing through flesh and armour with ease. When battle is done, Daemonettes stride amongst the fallen and bring their souls to Slaanesh's palace in the Realm of Chaos, to receive eternal pleasure or pain at the whim of their capricious master. As with all Daemons of Chaos these decadent creatures are highly resistant to physical attacks."

Steeds constantly taste the air with their long, whiplike tongues, sampling the scents and flavours of souls carried by the ever present the Winds of Magic and they are capable of hunting down almost any quarry, particularly when driven on by a Daemonette eager to deliver a new plaything to Slaanesh's embrace. In battle the claws of the Daemonette are the greatest threat presented by a Seeker, but the Steed itself carries a deadly weapon in the form of its impossibly dextrous tongue, constantly dripping poisons both deadly and psychoactive. Should the Daemonette be struck from her Steed the beast will fight on for the rest of the battle before returning to the Realm of Chaos.

They are just as vicious as those favoured by the Dark Elves as mounts, but more compact, heavily scaled, and arguably even more difficult to break in. Their skin oozes an unpleasant slime much like the Naggarothi Cold Ones, but it has unusual healing properties that make the beasts particularly resilient to injury.

Slaanesh is always hungry for morsels of courtly intrigue and such scraps can lead to the corrupting of a mortal ruler, a matter to which the Lord of Excess is always attentive. At times the Heralds carry their master's word to specific individuals singled out for divine notice. Not all such visitations are welcomed by those who receive them, for Slaanesh is nothing if not effusive in his tempers.

The Cult of Khaine hires out Assassins at exorbitant cost to the rulers of Naggaroth, though the price may come in forms other than merely coin. Such is the fiercely competitive and ruthless nature of Dark Elf society that there is never any shortage of willing employers or dark deeds to be performed from the shadows. Assassins are masters of many forms of combat, as their sect has collected martial lore from across the world, even as far abroad as Cathay and Ind, and make extensive use of poisons and acids to immobilise, weaken, and kill their targets. Their stealth, patience, and cunning in reaching their mark is as famed as their skills in combat. As agents of Khaine they are sacred to the Dark Elves. Khainite Assassins consider the tools of their trade a holy blessing from Khaine himself and will not exchange them for other equipment - additionally because they bear the Mark of Khaine they will be blessed at all times, for their entire life is but a devotion to the God of Murder."

While the vast majority were born into powerful clans or storied aristocratic families, it is possible for any Dark Elf, in theory, to seize a Noble title for himself, receiving a Writ of Iron from the Witch King Malekith himself. The bulk of these Nobles are known as Masters and it is they who lead most military forces and complete tasks for the near untouchable Dreadlords that rule over the cities and Black Arks of Naggaroth. Dark Elves abhor weakness beyond all else and while some Masters are courtly schemers and puppeteers that remain in the shadows, those that do take to the battlefield are, without exception, extremely skilled and disciplined tacticians and warriors in their own right. Masters are always well armed and armoured, outfitted by the finest craftsmen they can afford, though they must take care not to leave even the suggestion that the might be attempting to outshine any nearby Dreadlord."

#descr "Long before the Sundering split the Elves of Ulthuan into factions, the keen-eyed riders of Nagarythe kept guard against the signs of daeomonic intrusion, tirelessly seeking out the foes of their realm even in the direst of circumstances. During the civil war these same riders served Nagarythe as brutal raiders, travelling ahead of the warrior host to sow terror and confusion and break the morale of their cousins, showing them for the weak and soft people they had become. To this day Dark Riders still serve as messengers and advance forces for the great cities of Naggaroth, or are deployed to strike deep in enemy lands as harbingers of destruction. Their steeds, once purebred stock from Ulthuan, are now twisted with exposure to dark magic, though no less fleet of hoof for it. Heralds are the leaders of small Dark Rider groups, sometimes the youngest children of minor noble families, but usually Riders who have proven themselves and gained respect from their fellows as well as their superiors."

#descr "Dreadlords are the rulers of Black Arks, fortified outposts, or entire cities of Naggaroth and represent the pinnacle of the Dark Elven ideology of ambition, ruthlessness, and strength. Even moreso than Masters they are almost exclusively from high birth, backed by powerful and influential noble families and raised from a young age with the sole purpose of ascending to the station of Dreadlord. Unlike lesser nobles there is little chance that a Dreadlord could maintain his position without being an exceptionally skilled and experienced warrior in addition to a master of intrigue and courtly affairs, as each will inevitably find themselves appraised by the cold eye of the Witch King, Malekith, whose intolerance for weakness is legendary. Becoming a Dreadlord requires not only great martial skill and a brilliant tactical and strategic mind, but ambition that borders on the megalomaniacal and an absolutely iron will. In battle Dreadlords wield the finest arms and armour and ride atop the most vicious Cold One available."

In some ways they are like the Chaos Champions that arise from the human tribes that live in and around the Chaos Wastes, but Elves are far more resistant to the warping ways of Chaos and they are not destined for the fate of the Chaos Spawn or Daemonhood as a Daemon Prince. Their souls will doubtless eventually be claimed by the capricious Lord of Pleasure, but for now their allegiance to the youngest of the Chaos Gods greatly enhances their senses and abilities. Anointed tower over other Elves and have incredible strength of personality and presence, in addition to supernatural beauty and grace. In battle they are both capable generals and deadly personal combatants. Their only weakness is a reduced resistance to hostile magic caused by their enhanced senses and the invisible Chaos energies constantly swirling around them."

The practice of magic in Naggaroth is dominated by the Dark Convent of Sorceresses based in Ghrond, an order of great influence whose services are sought out by Masters and Dreadlords across the continent. Their grip on magical power is exacerbated by Malekith's interpretation of the Prophecy of Demise, for he believes he is the great warrior that might one day be cast from his throne by a male magic user. Initiates are the lowest ranking members of the Convent and are tasks with performing minor rituals, serving lesser nobles, and conducting much of the day to day research into the dark art of their order, though by the standards of lesser races they are still powerful mages."

Morathi long ago struck some manner of deal with Slaanesh and has on many occasions turned her people towards worship of the Dark Prince. It is Morathi's influence that has lead to the upper echelons of the Dark Convent experimenting with blood magic and it is thanks to her that no small number of Sorceresses have become devotees of Slaanesh. Slaaneshi Sorceresses must maintain the illusion that they are, like their fellows, loyal subjects of the Witch King that observe the official Khainite religion, but in reality they are full members of the Cult of Pleasure and have been inducted into direct worship of Slaanesh. The Dark Prince, though capricious, is a generous master and has lavished them with his blessings leaving them even more powerful than their fellows and able to seduce and corrupt others with ease. Strangely when they attempt to scry into the future, though, they see only writhing visions of Slaanesh's loving embrace."

Often they serve either Morathi or her son the Witch King Malekith directly, though as Malekith's trust in his mother has waned he has increasingly sought control over the upper echelons of the Convent. Supreme Sorceresses alone amongst their order can openly study blood magic, for the Hags of the Cult of Khaine, save perhaps Hellebron herself, lack the authority to stop them. In addition to their staggering magical power they are talented in the use of scrying and divination and are said to be able to gaze into the future as easily as one might look to the sky.

#descr "The Beastmasters of Clar Karond and Karond Kar can command even the unruliest creatures to do their bidding. In part this mastery stems from their unflinching dedication to the tormentors' craft, but brutality and fear alone would be nothing without the Dark Elf sense of empathy. All Elves have a natural attunement with the natural world, but while the High Elves and Wood Elves seek to gain wisdom from or live in balance with nature, the exiles of Naggaroth instead seek to dominate it. It matters not whether the beast is a raging Manticore, a viciously cunning Harpy, or a wise and ancient Dragon, given enough time a Beastmaster can impose their will upon it. Beastmasters are, in addition to their more fantastic charges, typically also responsible for the driving of slaves to battle, as the Dark Elves see humans, greenskins, and the like as mere beasts themselves. Their path is highly exacting and many eventually take on more than they can handle and are slain by one of their charges, so those that survive tend to be exceptionally cunning and martially skilled. High Beastmasters are so valued for their art and feared for their considerable skills that they hold status which nearly rivals that of the Dreadlords. Each month the Beastmaster may acquire and break in some new beasts to be used in battle, depending on the local terrain.

#descr "The Fellheart family has commanded the infamous Black Ark the Blessed Dread for generations, each noble born to ply the rolling seas, far more at home raiding distant shores than playing games of courtly intrigue on Naggaroth. Lokhir is the latest of his line and arguably the most daring. When Lokhir's father was slain by an assassin, the young Corsair immediately seized control of the Blessed Dread and sacrificed his rivals to the sea god Mathlann, then struck out to make his name. Tales soon reached Naggaroth of Lokhir's many deeds, the burning of High Elf port of To Canabrae greatest among them, and unimaginable treasure flowed to the coffers of Karond Kar once more. Lokhir is much admired by his crew, for he fights at the forefront of battle and never shies from a risky chance to take slaves and plunder. In battle Lokhir Fellheart can be easily recognised by the disturbing Kraken Mask he wears, plundered from an ancient sunken Lizardman city, which spreads terror amongst his foes and heals his wounds in seconds. He wields the paired Red Blades, forged from a statue of priceless Indan Bloodsteel looted from the Great Temple of Gilgadresh."

#name "Tyrant of Hag Graef"
#descr "Malus Darkblade, known as the Tyrant of Hag Graef, is one of the foremost Dreadlords of Naggaroth and the ruler of Hag Graef. Always ambitious and reckless, even for the bastard son of a Dark Elf noble family, Malus rose to be one of the foremost Masters of his city, but was frustrated by how long his ascent to power was taking. Hearing legends of a powerful artifact hidden to the north of Naggaroth he ventured into the Chaos Wastes and, though he lost most of his expedition in the process, reached the ancient temple of Kul Hadar. His senses blinded by avarice, Malus unwittingly allowed the Daemon Tz'arkan to possess him. To save his life and soul, Malus struck a deal with the Daemon to seek out five artifacts and perform a ritual that would free Tz'arkan, but having completed this quest the Daemon was not freed but instead forever bound to his own dark soul. Malus now battles constantly with Tz'arkan for control of his actions, but benefits from the considerable power of being bound to the Daemon. In battle Malus rides atop an especially vicious and unusually intelligent Cold One named Spite and is armed with the Warpsword of Khaine, greatest of the five artifacts his Tz'arkan had him recover."

#name "Hag Sorceress of Ghrond"
#descr "Morathi's existence has been one of scheming and manipulation. Who knows how many of Aenarion's darker deeds sprang from seeds she planted in his mind, or how different the history of the Elves might have been had he not rescued her from the clutches of a Slaaneshi warband? Yet for all of her beauty, her wiles, and Aenarion's passion for her, she was ultimately spurned by the first Phoenix King and the heartbreak of that betrayal has a perfect match in the aggrievement felt by all Dark Elves. Morathi's obsession has long been to see her son, Maelkith, ascend to his rightful place as ruler of Ulthuan, and the world beyond it, but her methods often run counter to Malekith's wishes and advance the power of the Chaos God Slaanesh, with whom she shares a long history. Morathi was behind the rise of the Cult of Pleasure which preceded the Sundering of the Elven race and she still uses that Cult to her advantage and secretly benefits from the blessings of the Dark Prince. Yet the Hag Sorceress is also greatly favoured by Khaine and, much to the disgust of her rival Crone Hellebron, is considered sacred to the Khainite faith. Morathi's beauty and presence are truly legendary, befitting a creature that can call even bitter rival Gods her patrons, and it would take a will of iron to resist her charm let alone raise a weapon against her. Morathi rides into battle atop her Dark Pegasus Sulephet, a creature she has bonded to her soul such that its life is forever bound to her own. She is primarily a user of magic, one of the greatest to ever live, but carries the dread spear Heartrender should she need to take a more direct approach."

#name "Death that Walks Unseen"
#descr "Shadowblade is still relatively young, having known less than two centuries of Maelkith's rule. His reputation, however, is legendary, and his arrogance as bottomless as the sea. Fables of his grisly exploits are already used as stories to scare Dark Elf children, a litany of murder and terror that grows longer and bloodier with each passing day. The incredible deeds of this assassin are hard to corroborate however, as few have ever encountered him and lived, and it is said that even Hellebron is unsure of his true identity, as Shadowblade personally slew all of his tutors. Furthermore, those that speak of his exploits risk word reaching Shadowblade, who values his reputation but guards his secrets carefully and is quick to hunt down those that would reveal them. Unlike other Khainite Assassins, Shadowblade reports directly to Hellebron as head of the Cult of Khaine and it is rumoured she has made use of his talents to ensure her position is unchallenged. Shadowblade is an exceptional assassin, perhaps matched only be the mythic Deathmaster of the Skaven Clan Eshin, or the sorceror-assassins of the far east. In battle he makes use of the typical Khainite tools of murder, but also carries the Heart of Woe, an amulet enchanted to explode in a paralysing fireblast should he ever be slain, and has been gifted a potion by Hellebron that temporarily grants him the strength of a giant. Unlike his fellows Shadowblade has been granted special dispensation from Hellebron to employ full use of any magical items that would be of use in slaughtering his targets. As with other Khainite Assassins, Shadowblade is permanently blessed with the Mark of Khaine."

#descr "Crone Hellebron is the most ancient and powerful of the Hags of the Cult of Khaine and second only to Morathi amongst the female rulers of Naggaroth. The rivalry between Morathi and Hellebron is intense, for Morathi has withheld the secrets of her eternallly youthful appearance from Hellebron, who has grown old and lost the spectacular beauty of her youth, now preferring to hide her face behind a ceremonial mask. Only through increasingly huge blood rituals can Hellebron fully regain the alluring visage she was once praised for across the continent and even then the effects of the ritual barely last for a few days. Hellebron suspects, correctly, that Morathi traffics with the Cult of Pleasure and the corruption of Slaanesh, yet if she holds definite proof she has yet to act on it. As the leader of the cult of Khaine Hellebron wields considerable priestly power but her true strength is her mastery of the arts of murder and slaughter, for she has spent many centuries faithfully learning and training in the infinite methods of violence that are the domain of her God. In battle Hellebron wields two lethal artifacts of a bygone age; the Deathsword which grants her incredible strength and the Cursed Blade which parries and slashes with a life of its own. In addition her station as Blood Queen has granted her use of the Amulet of Dark Fire, which will protect any army Hellebron accompanies from hostile magic. As with the Death Hags that serve her, Crone Hellebron cannot use magic in battle but can make powerful prayers to Khaine.

---------------- EVENTS --------------------

---------------- WELCOME TO DARK ELVES -----------------

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! The Dark Elves mod has some special mechanics which make them a little different from other nations:

Enslavement. When you conquer a province with a commander and 15+ troops and the province population is > 2000, some of the population are enslaved and sent to one of your forts, granting resources, gold, population, and battle slaves. With 20+ troops there is an event for population > 4000 and with 25+ an event for population > 6000. Each size of event can trigger 3 times each turn, for a total of 9 possible Enslavement events.

Corsair Coves. If a Corsair Captain is in a Dark Elf coastal province he might establish a Corsair Cove. This provides about 30 gold a turn, silently. If taken by an enemy it causes unrest for them, though they can dismantle it by reducing that unrest. If the unrest is high enough, Corsairs may attempt to retake the province for you. Coves on or neighbouring a fort are automatically dismantled.

Cult of Pleasure. Your forts can harbour the Cult of Pleasure, which starts quietly as Decadent Gatherings and grows over time. High dominion (yours or an enemies) can reduce the Cult, while low dominion encourages their growth, as does the presence of Pleasure Cultists. The Cult offers new recruitment options but can destroy your temple in the province, or worse."

---------------- SLAVING EVENTS ----------------------

--- an alternative solution to this is using PD. Give everyone an event that always grants 1 PD to all 0 PD provinces. Then check which province has 0 PD. That will tell you it was just conquered.


----- The basic idea here is that when a province is conquered by dark elves if it is above 2k, 4k, or 6k in pop and the dark elf force meets some basic criteria it gets a corresponding flag. There can only be 3 flags for each size, per turn. Any more conquering than that doesn't trigger the slaving events.
----- Each turn three of these flags for each type (pop size) are processed, sending a reward to a random dark elf fort. These events have to be delay 0, because they need to definitely fire after flags are placed. Unfortunately the random fort is only picked once per turn.

----- ADD A FLAG MONSTER signifying that Dark Elves conquered this province if it is owned by dark elves and does not contain a 'Dark Elves' site if it has over a certain population
------- ALSO kill a chunk of population, commensurate with size
------- plus adds the 'Dark Elves' site
------- REQUIRES at least 20 friendly troops to be present AND requires a non sneaking commander

---------------- CULT OF PLEASURE EVENTS ---------------

--- A thing I did consider was an event that turns one of your commanders into a version of itself that battle summons a bunch of followers (10 or so maybe)
--- And tries to assassinate them with the rival type of commander (also a version that battle summons dudes)
--- And if they survive, turns them back to normal. That would make little off to the side skirmishes

----- Turns out req_5monsters and req_2monsters only work once per event, so I'm choosing to not really use them, though a workaround with flag monsters is fairly easy to do if I want to in the future

#brief "The Dark Elves, or Druchii, are exiles from the High Elven land of Ulthuan who now dwell in the cold expanse of Naggaroth. They are ambitious, cruel, martially skilled, and magically powerful. Dark Elves view all other races as lesser and are notorious raiders and slavers."

#descr "In the chill land of Naggaroth lies a realm steeped in malice. This is the home of the Dark Elves, the outcast warrior children of Ulthuan. They watch the world with malevolent eyes, knowing it is their birthright to rule and the destiny of all others to serve, if they are permitted to live at all. Yet the Dark Elves know that they cannot claim their glorious inheritance while the hated betrayers the High Elves endure. They are two halves of a race sundered long ago, separated by the greatest betrayal ever to occur in all the ages of the world, when the soft and weak Asur cast out those who had loyally fought to defend their homeland. Even should every other land bow to their rule, the Naggarothi will not rest until they have brought ruin to the traitors of Ulthuan, toppled their temples, and driven them into the sea. On that day the Witch King of Naggaroth, Malekith himself, will finally claim a throne long denied him, and the rule of the Dark Elves will spread to every corner of the world."

#summary "Race: Dark Elves, cruel, skilled, and magically gifted.
Military: Elite infantry and cavalry, battle-slave fodder, and lightly armoured specialists.
Magic: Strong death and astral, decent fire, air, water, and blood.
Priests: Average. May perform blood sacrifice.
Mechanics: Cult of Pleasure grows in low dominion forts and offers new recruitables. Corsairs set up Coves in coastal provinces. Armies enslave as they conquer."

The shield itself protects its owner twofold, for it will grant them skin of stone and the vengeful spirits of lost Karak Azgul will strike at those who harm the bearer. There is a bitterness in forging such runes now the hold is lost and a great sadness and weight will be placed on the shoulders of any who wield this shield in battle, tiring them and sapping their energy.

---- Steelbeard Helm

#selectitem 930
#spr "./Sombre_Warhammer/Warhammer_Dwarfs/Item_Helm.tga"
#name "Steelbeard Helm"
#descr "Himnir Steelbeard was a famous Thane who died defending the long lost Dwarfhold of Karak Azgul. Before his death at the breached gates, he slew the Orc warlord Gruthak and threw the invading greenskins into disarray, granting the Dwarfhold of Karaz-a-Karak precious time to organise their defences. It is sung that crude weapons of the enemy could not pierce Himnir's skin and that even his beard deflected their blows with contempt. This helmet has been crafted in his honour and will render the wearer highly resistant to mundane blows, as well as granting its wearer perfect vision even in pitch black darkness and the ability to perceive spirits."

Consequently they allow the wearer to strike with incredible force but at great speed and with little encumbrance. The gauntlets almost seem to have a mind of their own as they pummel the foe with an avalanche of iron blows.

#selectitem 932

#name "Book of Grudges"
#descr "Every Dwarf, every clan, and every Dwarfhold has their own Book of Grudges, a list of all the wrongs done to them that must be repaid in full, or perhaps repaid many times over should the Grudge be sufficiently old. Typically the personal volumes of Dwarfs are relatively simple tomes, but occasionally a Dwarf will choose to have their Book of Grudges wrought by a Runesmith, the grudges written on leaves of steel and silver and bound with covers of stone. Taking up such a Book of Grudges is a solemn and unbreakable vow to dedicate the rest of the Dwarf's long live to avenging them, at the exclusion of other duties, and as such is not a common practice. A forged Book of Grudges is such a commitment that it attracts the attention of Ancestor Spirits with a vested interest in seeing the grudges avenged and they lend their power to the bearer, rapidly healing their wounds, granting them sacred status in the eyes of other Dwarfs, and providing them with a blessing at all times. Although powerful, such a tome is great burden both literally and figuratively."

It is the protection of this vital trade that is the primary duty of the Rangers, for there are countless foes that would see Dwarf caravans as juicy targets and perhaps even kidnap traders to ransom them to the Dwarfholds.

Should a Dwarf suffer some terrible personal tragedy, he will be inconsolable. The loss of his family, failure to uphold an oath or even getting forsaken in love can seriously unhinge the mind of a Dwarf. Sometimes these Dwarfs decide that the only way they can keep up the honour of their clan is to forsake any ties to his clan and become a slayer. Having forsaken everything he holds dear, the slayer seeks death by finding large monsters to fight, immune to any feelings of terror. Few manage to survive even their first encounter, but those who do are tough, violent and psychopathically dangerous. They can be easily identified by their dyed orange hair and scarred tough skin.

There are some who, having failed one too many times to find an honourable death in battle at the hands of a large creature become so desperate to meet their end by any hostile means that they shave off their slayer crests and become Doomseekers. Doomseekers care not what brings them death so long as it is in battle and as such do not specialise in seeking out powerful creatures such as trolls or giants, rather they prefer to pitch themselves into thick enemy ranks and trust the quantity of their foes to spell their doom. Still they are proud Dwarfs and hold great hatred for the enemies of their kind, so they have adapted their weapons and fighting style to best allow them to slaughter throngs of lesser foes. Doomseekers are armed with axeheads attached to lengths of chain wrapped about their arms and in battle act as a whirling storm of spinning death. While quite mad their truly extreme dedication to ending their life makes them sacred to the followers of Grimnir.

Ironbreakers are often called to fight in the most remote depths of the caves and passages of the underworld against all manner of horrors and are specially trained to do battle in darkness.

Rather than using the Ironbreaker hammer and shield they use Firedrakes, an invention of the Engineers Guild that is essentially a small battering ram capable of spraying a burning alchemical concoction on the ranks of the enemy. Though the Firedrake is a magnificent piece of craftsmanship it is not terribly accurate and as such the Irondrakes wear armour protected with runes which ward against fire and even protect their beards with segmented Gromril plates. Irondrakes specialise in defeating the massed ranks of lesser foes that might bog down and overwhelm the traditional shieldwall through attrition.

However, unlike human nobles, Dwarf thanes are not born into their position, but picked by the council of elders. As a result, only Dwarfs who are skilled administrators and warriors act as Thanes, making sure that clan is always lead by the brightest minds and strongest hands within the clan. Dwarfs are a people well prepared for to survive and Thanes are trained to ensure the good order of provinces even if they are cut off from their homeland."

#descr "The Dwarfs have many enemies and few friends amongst the other races of this world. It doesn't help that Dwarf communities are spread out in order to possess the richest mineral veins the earth can offer. Hence, it's quite common for a Dwarfhold to become sieged and find itself in need of assistance from other clans. But Dwarfs have their ways to make sure that messages run between the holds, no matter what. Young, agile and brave Dwarfs are sometimes trained as 'Runebearers', to become experts of the Underway and untiring runners. Their ability to travel between provinces is unmatched, as they are able to use the ancient Dwarf tunnels to short cut and carry magical runes of endurance. They sometimes lead small squads of miners through the dangers of the Underway."

The king is advised by the Council of Elders and the combined wisdom and strength of these parts make for a stable government. Clan Kings are not only great warriors and leaders, but also historians, knowing their ancestors and the many wrongs dealt to them by heart. Kings are guardians of their people but also have a duty to avenge these wrongs and will enthusiastically seek to repay the grudges of the clan twicefold. Their equipment is naturally second to none, being finely wrought by the greatest craftsdwarfs of the clan and often passed down from a lost gold age of their people. Kings are martial, social, and spiritual leaders and as such are sacred to their clan."

#descr "The Dwarfs are industrious people and highly skilled in the ways of engineering, the quality and reliability of their constructions being widely regarded as the best in the world. Most Dwarf inventions are practical and functional, like pumps to clear water from mine workings and simple engines to draw cages up vertical shafts. However centuries of constant warfare as their civilisation has been pressed from all sides by forces of destruction have led to numerous applications of engineering skill to the subject of warfare. Members of the Guild of Engineers incorporate the use of Rune Magic into some of their work but are not trained to use magic themselves, instead providing their knowledge of fortification, siege, and construction to the war effort along with maintaining their many inventions. Engineers are masters of physics and mathematics and can help nearby Dwarfs, even magic users, calibrate for ranged accuracy at the start of battle. In addition they are able to oversee repairs and construction to restore Dwarfholds to some measure of their former glory.

#descr "The Dwarfs are an ancient and hardy race from beneath the mountains. All of them are above all proud individuals and do not cope easily with failure or personal loss. The loss of his family, failure to uphold an oath or even getting forsaken in love can seriously unhinge the mind of a Dwarf. Sometimes these Dwarfs decide that the only way they can keep up the honour of their clan is to cut any ties to his clan and become a slayer. Having forsaken everything he holds dear, the slayer seeks death by finding large monsters to fight. Few manage to survive even their first encounter, but those who do are tough, violent and dangerous. They can be easily identified by their dyed orange hair and scarred tough skin. This Slayer has managed to slay a Troll in battle, a clear sign that he has been marked out for a great death by Grimnir. He is now tasked with ending the life of a foul Giant. Giantslayers bear the mark of Drengi and though they seek a worthy death, they have a supernatural ability to avoid mortal blows. The presence of a Giantslayer in battle will enhance the potency of the magical tattoos of other Slayers.

#descr "Dwarfs are naturally highly resistant to magic and find it hard to use, despite their strong interest in education and dedication to craft. They are a highly resourceful people though, and have developed practices which allow them to use magic in a structured and practical fashion well suited to their patient minds. Rune Magic is the most pervasive form used by Dwarfs and is based on storing and shaping magic through their runic language, bypassing the drawbacks of magically Drained environment. Rune Magic is especially powerful in forging magical items but also allows for the use of ritual spells constructed over a longer period, though it is rather poorly suited to the hectic envrionment of the battlefield. The Guild of Runesmiths is greatly admired within Dwarf society and wields considerable power, so it is never short of Apprentices. Rune Magic is extremely demanding and difficult to master, requiring both natural talent and lifelong dedication, so it is not uncommon for an Apprentice to never rise above this rank. Apprentices typically contribute to the routine arming of the troops rather than pursuing works of higher craftsmanship and their focus on lesser Rune Magic means they do not lose magical power in battle, unlike some other Runesmiths.

#descr "Dwarfs are naturally highly resistant to magic and find it hard to use, despite their strong interest in education and dedication to craft. They are a highly resourceful people though, and have developed practices which allow them to use magic in a structured and practical fashion well suited to their patient minds. Rune Magic is the most pervasive form used by Dwarfs and is based on storing and shaping magic through their runic language, bypassing the drawbacks of magically Drained environment. Rune Magic is especially powerful in forging magical items but also allows for the use of ritual spells constructed over a longer period, though it is rather poorly suited to the hectic envrionment of the battlefield. Runelords are the most powerful Runesmiths, masters many times over who have dedicated their lives to Rune Magic. They are near peerless smiths of magical items and capable of casting powerful ritual spells. While Clan Kings may hold the highest status in Dwarf society, Runelords are revered as irreplacable paragons of Dwarfdom and their counsel is sought on any matter of great importance, for they speak with the wisdom of the ancestors.

#descr "Only very few slayers manage to slay a Troll and survive. Even fewer actually manage to find and slay a Giant without getting squashed. But there are some who manage to complete these heroic deeds and have not yet succeeded in their ultimate goal of a glorious death in battle. These scarred veteran Slayers are known as Dragonslayers, and they are mighty indeed. No matter what kind of beast they face in battle, these heroes always seem to come out on top. This might be due to the blessings of the fickle gods, who have a great destiny in store for this great warrior. Their frightening battle-cry will sap strength from their foes, who will know that only death awaits those who face this chosen warrior in combat. Their quest for death has taken them all around the world and they know how to traverse even the most hostile terrain. Dragonslayers bear the mark of Drengi and though they seek a worthy death, they have a supernatural ability to avoid mortal blows. The presence of a Dragonslayer in battle will enhance the magical tattoos of other Slayers. Having proven themselves to Grimnir they have attained sacred status.

With these artifacts they are able to hurl bolts of lightning great distances and with considerable accuracy, delivering powerful jolts of electricity which completely bypass armour. Thunder Staffs also make formidable melee weapons, being well balanced Dwarf steel and still capable of delivering a fatal jolt. Thunder Staffs can only be forged with great difficulty, but should the Dwarfs ever recover enough of their lost Golden Age forges they would be able to steadily outfit a small number of these troops. Dwarf troops gladly use their own wealth to support the military efforts of their nation and require only a quarter of the usual upkeep in gold."

#descr "In the Golden Age of the Dwarfs it is said that even minor Dwarfholds could field multiple Runesmiths each with an Anvil of Doom, an enchanted anvil that allowed the use of powerful Rune Magic on the battlefield and allowed the Dwarfs to overcome their magical disadvantages. As the Dwarf empire declined many of these artifacts were lost, the art of their enchantment and usage was taken to the grave by tradition-bound Runelords, or they simply lost their power. They are now a rare sight, though no less powerful than ever. At this crucial moment as the Dwarf seeks to restore their former glory, many Runelords have rediscovered methods to reactivate a dormant Anvil of Doom and so they are once more being deployed on the battlefield. Now that the Runelord has taken position at an Anvil of Doom he no longer loses magical power in battle and by striking his hammer upon the ancient runes of the Anvil, is able to cast spells at a greatly increased rate. Further, the Anvil will constantly reinvigorate its user and entirely protect them from lightning.

#descr "Thorek Ironbrow is one of the few remaining members of the Ironbrow clan, a once mighty house shattered by the fall of their home of Karak Azgul. Thorek's legendary dedication to his craft and to the elevation of his people was shaped by the terrible fate of his own clan and though he calls Karak Azul home, like every Ironbrow he longs to reclaim his clan's former Dwarfhold. Thorek is a traditionalist even by the standards of Dwarf Runesmiths and holds no truck with whatever runes might be fashionable this century or that, tirelessly sticking to redisovering and mastering the ancient runes, so many of which were lost after the Golden Age ended. Thorek is the keeper of Karak Azul's last active Anvil of Doom and is known to have an understanding of the mighty artifact far beyond that of other Runelords. Indeed while Thorek is extremely demanding and some would say tightfisted when it comes to teaching rune lore to other Runesmiths, it is possible that the Dwarfs would have no hope of some day reactivating the runes on dormant Anvils of Doom without his contributions to their study. Unlike some Runesmiths Thorek is not content to bitterly mourn the Dwarfs losses and instead takes the same position of Dwarfs like King Alrik Ranulfsson and High King Thorgrim Grudgebearer; that his people may retake what has been lost and end their decline. In battle Thorek makes full use of his Anvil of Doom and is the only living Dwarf capable of striking the infamous Master Rune of Doom. He personally forged and runed his hammer Klad Brakak with an entirely new rune of his own devising, based on the Ironbreaker rune, and wears armour of masterfully runed gromril metal.

Though reinforcements did finally arrive they were far too late to do anything to recover the hold and indeed could not recover more than a few of the thousands of bodies of their fallen brothers and sisters. In recognition of the bravery of those last defenders of Karak Azgul and as a promise of vengeance to their murderers, a memorial was constructed far from the fallen hold listing every one of their names. Recently the monument has begun to whisper and share knowledge that was lost long ago. It knows powerful ways to forge once lost. Now it guides the High King and the Runelords and has a plan to restore the Dwarfs to their former glory."

#name "Master Brewer"
#descr "Josef Bugman is the most famous Master Brewer of all time, which amongst Dwarfkind is really saying something. Dwarfs love their ale and take it as seriously as they do any other craft but even so the Bugman name is synonymous with another level of quality. A member of the Dragonback clan, after the fall of Ekrund Josef's clan established a brewery in the foothills of the Grey Mountains. Once Josef took over the brewery quickly became renowned across the Old World, but at the height of its success disaster struck: Greenskin raiders attacked while Josef was away, burning down his home and making off with his few relatives that survived. In the smouldering ruins Bugman swore a mighty oath of vengeance and took up his ancestral axe, resolving never to set it down until he had taken his full revenge on the Greenskin filth. Over the decades many rangers have joined Bugman on his quest and they have slain countless foes, yet Bugman maintains he has barely even begun his revenge. Josef carries a powerful runeaxe and a magical tankard which constantly heals him or wounded troops. Before battle he lifts the spirits of the troops with both tales of his many victories over the Greenskins and tankards of his superb ale.

#descr "It is a bitter legacy of hatred and resentment that Belegar Ironhammer has inherited, for he is the leader of the Angrund Clan and direct descendant of King Lunn, the last Dwarf to sit on the throne of Karak Eight Peaks before its fall. Many of the ruling heirs of Angrund have attempted to reclaim their lost home and all have failed, but when Belegar came of age he made bold oaths and set out to recover his full inheritance and restore his Clan's honour. In the many decades since that time Belegar has achieved more than any of his predecessors and won countless battles against the Skaven and Greenskins that infest the Eight Peaks yet has still not reclaimed his throne, though Clan Angrund does now have a foothold on the surface of the lost Dwarfhold. Belegar is known as a tireless and skilled warrior, exceeded only by the famous Slayer King Ungrim Ironfist in martial prowess, and is a legendarily canny strategist, particularly when it comes to siege warfare. He strides into battle bearing the ancient Shield of Defiance and the devastating Hammer of Angrund, symbols of the strength and resolve of his people."

#descr "The tale of Ungrim's family is one of a history of calamities. King Baragor, Ungrim's five times great grandsire, suffered a terrible loss that drove him to take the Slayer Oath and become the first Slayer King of Karak Kadrin. Torn between his dual Oaths to seek death as a Slayer and protect his people as King, he settled on establishing the massive Slayer Shrine of Karak Kadrin and passing on the Slayer Oath to his offspring. Although Ungrim cannot truly seek death as a Slayer he is by far the most restless and warlike Dwarf King and constantly leads his Dwarfhold to battle. Armed with the monstrously powerful Axe of Dargo, cloaked in the skin of the Dragon Fyrskar and with the Slayer Crown upon his head, he is a nearly unmatched dealer of death on the battlefield. As a Slayer Ungrim bears the mark of Drengi and is supernaturally able to avoid mortal blows. Ungrim is greatly revered amongst the Slayers and has attained sacred status for his dedication to their ways."

#fixedname "Kragg the Grim"
#descr "Kragg is the Master Runelord of the Runesmith's Guild. He is the oldest and by far the most experienced living Runesmith - a gnarled old Dwarf, strong and enduring as weather-beaten boulder. His expression is one of eternal disapproval, his beetling brow and granite-like face a withering condemnation of younger, more frivolous Dwarfs. This is quite normal for a Dwarf of his age who has seen many wonders and watched the inevitable decline of craftsmanship and respect. Runesmiths from across the Dwarf realms pay homage to him, for Kragg knows many ancient secrets and acts as a living embodiment of the legendary history of the Dwarfs. Kragg rarely emerges from the Underhalls, preferring instead to labour secretly on his craft and seek to recover the lost arts, jealously guarding any rediscovered lore. Perhaps one day he will find a worthy successor, but so far none have met his exacting standards, much to the chagrin of many talented and aspiring Runesmiths. Kragg is particularly favoured by the Ancestor Spirits and does not lose magical might in combat like most runesmiths. It is rumoured that Kragg holds the knowledge to reactivate an ancient Anvil of Doom, but for his own enigmatic reasons has chosen not to do so. Thusfar none have dared question his decision. Kragg's crowning achievement is his own personal rune, inscribed on his hammer, which transfers heat to any object it strikes, making it both more efficient when forging and also far more lethal in battle.

#descr "Burlok Damminson is the current master of the Engineers Guild and regarded as one of the greatest Engineers of all time. A stern and exacting Master, he demands adherence to traditional engineering tenets from his Engineers and rejects inventions or theories which diverge from this dogmatic approach. Yet it was not always so; in his youth, already considered an Engineering genius, Burlok was quick to defy the warnings from older Engineers and created many exotic and outlandish machines, believing that field testing and trial-by-error was necessary to make progress. This all ended when, following an experiment with a new steam pressure vessel, Burlok lost his workshop and his left arm in a massive explosion. Chastened by the experience and scolded by his father from bringing disrepute to their family, Burlok took his youthful energy and clear genius and applied it to the proper Dwarf path of Engineering; gradually and painstakingly building of centuries of quality work. Burlok created a mechanical arm to replace his lost limb, truly one of the wonders of the world, and in battle wields a hammer inscribed with a rune of swiftness as well as his master-crafted arbalest.

#descr "Thorgrim Grudgebearer is the current High King of the Dwarfs, a position to which he was unanimously appointed by the council of Clan Kings both for his incredible deeds in avenging grudges and recovering lost artifacts and his inspiring vow to strike every grudge from the Dammaz Kron, the Great Book of Grudges. Such an oath is of course impossible, for not even in a hundred lifetimes could any High King achieve such a feat, but Thorgrim's unwavering commitment to seeking justice for his people has energised them in a way no High King has managed for generations. As the High King Thorgim is duty bound to be born into battle atop the Throne of Power, the ancient seat of Dwarf rulership, which is inscribed with lost runes of power, protection, and healing which protect both the King and his Thronebearers. Atop his brow rests the Dragon Crown of Karaz, once worn by the founder of Karaz-a-Karak, protecting him from harm is the master-wrought Armour of Skaldour, and in his hand the fabled Axe of Grimnir, the final gift of the Dwarf God of War to his people before he departed north never to be seen again. In battle Thorgrim is a bulwark of Dwarf might, ingenuity, and resolve, reading aloud from the Great Book of Grudges even as he carves a path through the enemy ranks. Such is the power of this reading that any who stand before him on the field of battle will be forever cursed.

#descr "King Kazador of Karak Azul is huge for a Dwarf, standing a head above his peers and sporting even more thick muscle. Even as a young Dwarf he was marked out as special, taking a carefree pleasure in excelling in the crafts of his people, tirelessly labouring alongside those he would one day rule and gambling, drinking, and hunting Greenskins in the mountains of his ancestors. As a King he ruled wisely and energetically, avenging many of Karak Azul's Grudges and establishing his Dwarfhold as a true power in the South, the only remaining Dwarf Kingdom to be such. Yet when leading his throng on a campaign to annihilate several Goblin strongholds Kaador received disastrous news: the infamous Orc Warlord Gorfang Rotgut had launched a lightning raid on the hold, captured most of the royal family including Kazador's wife, and humiliated his son and heir by shaving his beard and tattooing a crude Orc glyph on his head. From that day on Kazador was a changed Dwarf, dour and brooding, his previous lust for life transformed into an obsessive drive for vengeance, particularly against the Greenskins. Kazador carries three heirlooms of his hold to battle: a terrible and powerful warhammer, rune engraved gromril armour, and the legendary Thunderhorn. Such is Kazador's reputation for violent revenge and the depth of his grief that as he strides into battle blowing reverberating notes on the Thunderhorn his foes find themselves filled with fear and panic."

As the Dwarf empire declined many of these artifacts were lost, the art of their enchantment and usage was taken to the grave by tradition-bound Runelords, or they simply lost their power. They are now a rare sight, though no less powerful than ever. At this crucial moment as the Dwarf seeks to restore their former glory, many Runelords have rediscovered methods to reactivate a dormant Anvil of Doom.

Such is the sacred importance of the Anvil that a group of Runeguard will be assigned to protect the Runelord and artifact both."

Thunderers are Dwarf warriors trained in the use of the Thunder Staff, an weapon invented by Runesmiths in the golden age and refined by the Guild of Engineers. With these artifacts they are able to hurl bolts of lightning great distances and with considerable accuracy, delivering powerful jolts of electricity which completely bypass armour. Thunder Staffs also make formidable melee weapons, being well balanced Dwarf steel and still capable of delivering a fatal jolt."

#name "Debts Unpaid"
#descr "Dwarfs believe that no Dwarf can travel to the afterlife and sit amongst their ancestors in the Hall of Dwarrows if they perish with a personal Grudge unavenged. Those slain Dwarfs who are so barred from peace remain tied to their descendents as Ancestor Spirits able to provide advice and aid to them such that they might avenge the Great Grudge or complete tasks left undone. Though they are all greatly respected most Ancestor Spirits can only provide insubstantial help to their Clan in the form of their wisdom and blessings, or perhaps minor curses upon those that wrong them, but some Dwarfs, or Grudges, are so powerful that the Ancestor Spirit is able to manifest and seek direct vengeance in battle. This is particularly common with Kings, for the great wrongs done to a Clan or Dwarfkind in general may be taken as personal Grudges by rulers of sufficient authority. This spell will call upon the spirit of a great Dwarf hero from the Hall of Fame and grant him an ethereal form so that he may fight again and avenge his Grudges. Ancestor Spirits are not capable of using magic of any form, but are sacred and will retain any priestly authority."

#name "Master Rune of Doom"
#descr "The Master Rune of Doom was designed by the legendary Runelord Kurgaz, creator of the Anvil of Doom during the Golden Age of the Dwarfs. It is said that once every Runesmith who used an Anvil of Doom could, should the situation require it, strike this incredibly powerful rune and bring doom to their enemies. However this time is long passed and now only old Thorek Ironbrow, the greatest living Runesmith, has the ability to strike the rune successfully - and even Thorek has sworn he will not risk striking it until his people have discovered a way to reactivate the many dormant Anvils of Doom, for doing so risks his own Anvil of Doom and the knowledge he has accumulated and not yet passed on. When struck the Master Rune of Doom will instantly plunge the battlefield into darkness as the power of the Ancestor Spirits is gathered and twelve Ancestor Spirits will emerge from around the Anvil determined to avenge their people."
#details "Effectively this casts Darkness and summons 12 sacred Ancestor Spirits as troops. This spell may only ever be cast by the national hero Thorek Ironbrow, the Runelord of Anvils. It's also very slow to cast and extremely tiring."

-------- NATION

#selectnation 117
#name "Dwarfs"
#epithet "Ancestral Grudges"
#era 2
#brief "The Dwarf empire is composed of hardy Dwarfs clad in superior equipment, but they are expensive both in gold and resources. They rely on various types of infantry and have no cavalry or special monsters, just Dwarf steel and skill. They are slow on the battlefield but good marchers and have some special units can travel underground for mobility. Their magic is not well suited to the battlefield but they are nearly unparalleled smiths and builders."
#descr "The Dwarfs are an ancient race, said to have been sculpted from solid stone by Pantokrator in the early days. This seems plausible, for the spirit and body of a Dwarf are hardy like stone. Centuries ago the Dwarfs enjoyed an era of peace and prosperity known as the Golden Age, with an empire of Dwarfholds connected by countless underground passages and featuring powerful militaries and rune-endowed halls full of laughter and song. However the Dwarfs found they had many enemies and very few true friends, as the arrogant Elves attacked them and hordes of Greenskins and foul Skaven swarmed against their defences. In time the great race of the Dwarfs, strong as they may have been, were reduced to a shadow of their former glory, eroded much as a mighty mountain is by mere rain and wind. But as the other races squabble amongst themselves and forget the wisdom of their fathers, Dwarfs hone their skills and work together to build a second empire. As the the time of the ascension wars draws closer, the power of Dwarf determination grows stronger. Dwarfs are few in number, but each one of them is equipped with Dwarf steel and draws power from the spirits of his wronged ancestors."
#summary "Race: Hardy Dwarfs with excellent morale and magic resistance. Prefers Cold scale +1.
Military: Superb heavy infantry and crossbows. No cavalry. High resource costs.
Magic: Strong Earth, fire, astral, minor access to water and air. Rune Magic is weaker in battle. Drain immune.
Priests: Powerful, sometimes protected by Ancestor Spirits.
Mechanics: Forts cost 150%. Discover and defend special sites in mountains and caves to upgrade the capital significantly."

---- WELCOME EVENT

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! The Dwarfs mod has a special mechanic which makes them a little different from other nations:

Upgrading Capital Sites. Every turn in any mountain or cave province that you control and have positive dominion in there is a chance that a Lost site from the Golden Age of the Dwarfs will be unearthed (it will simply spawn, you don't need to search). There are three types of these Lost sites; Forge, Gold, and Gromril, corresponding to three of your starting capital sites. Each of these Lost sites has a chance each turn to be used to permanently upgrade the corresponding capital site. This can only happen if you control both the province with the Lost site and your capital province and have positive dominion in both - if you lose control of a province containing a Lost site it will be gone forever. Each capital site can be upgraded three times and each type of Lost site can only appear three times during a game, so if you want to fully upgrade all three capital sites you should be careful to protect them once they've appeared.

Forge give gems, Gromril gives gems and resources, Gold gives gold. A Forge or Gromril site upgraded to tier 3 or 4 will also allow you to recruit two Thunderers and two Irondrakes respectively each turn."

They should not be mistaken for true elites or heavy infantry, but can be relied on to engage and destroy lesser enemy regiments or hold the line against more skilled foes. Their knowledge of fencing makes them a difficult prospect for sworn enemies of the Empire such as Greenskins and Beastmen, who tend to rely on brute force over skill. Despite being seen as rather flashy and romantic fighters, Swordsmen are as well drilled as other State Troops."

#name "Order Knight"
#descr "There are numerous Knightly Orders throughout the Empire and though they are typically autonomous from Imperial rule when the Empire is in peril they will undoubtedly lead the charge to battle. They recruit mainly from noble families, but the exact conditions of acceptance vary from order to order and may require an oath not only to their brother knights and Grand Master, but to a particular patron deity. Imperial Knights wear Dwarf forged full plate of incredible quality, arm themselves with broadswords and lances and ride heavy warhorses into battle. The impact of their charge is second only to the Lance formations of Bretonnia and can turn the tide of battle in a heartbeat. While many orders have a strong religious element their strict loyalty to their Grand Master and Inner Circle above all else keeps them from taking the role of sacred warriors."

#name "Winged Lancer"
#descr "The Winged Lancers of Kislev are a Gospodar tradition dating back hundreds of years. They are famed for their elaborate armour, particularly the eagle feather 'wings' mounted on their backs, which make an eerie sound as they charge to battle. The Winged Lancers favour a devastating charge and in this respect they are more devastating than even the knightly orders, though they lack their dwarf-forged plate armour. No Gospodar could ever match the skill and speed of an Ungol horseman, for they learn to ride before they walk, but the Winged Lancers are mounted on the same superior mounts and can easily outpace the heavy cavalry of the Empire."

They then close in and unleash the second crossbow of the pair at point blank range, before engaging with their swords. Though they are a far cry from the heavy cavalry of the Knightly Orders, they are well equipped by their wealthy families and fare well against enemy infantry even in close quarters."

These bands are compelled by a divine calling to hurl themselves into battle in a gesture of sacrifice and doom, showing no fear, pain or mercy.

They are an elite within an elite who form the personal bodyguard of the Grand Master and are a powerful force on the battlefield. The Order of the Knights of Sigmar's Blood are one of the few true Templar Orders, those whose membership consists entirely of men sworn to the service of their god. The Knights of Sigmar's Blood are particularly fanatical in prosecuting their duty to the founder-god of the Empire and on occasion have made enemies of other orders, Elector Counts, and even the the Colleges of Magic through their zealous pursuit of holy justice. The Order is currently based out of Averland and has ties to the powerful Leitdorf family, which perhaps goes some way to explaining the considerable leeway they are granted. The Knights of Simgar's Blood use a combination of a heavy lance on the charge and a hammer, the weapon of Sigmar, in melee."

A relatively small order, the Knights of the Blazing Sun formed during a sortie to liberate the Temple of Myrmidia in Estalia from the forces of Araby. During fierce fighting within the temple itself, a small group of knights were cut off from their fellows and faced certain doom. They were saved when a sudden tremor toppled a great statue of Myrdmia which crashed down on their foes, killing them to a man. The knights took this as divine intervention and formed an order dedicated to this strange Eastern deity, building a shrine to Myrmidia in the heart of Talabheim. Their devotion to Myrmidia has rendered them virtually immune to fire."

#descr "Each Knightly Order is ruled by a council of the most experienced and talented Brother Knights known as the Inner Circle. They are an elite within an elite who form the personal bodyguard of the Grand Master and are a powerful force on the battlefield. A relatively small order, the Knights of the Blazing Sun formed during a sortie to liberate the Temple of Myrmidia in Estalia from the forces of Araby. During fierce fighting within the temple itself, a small group of knights were cut off from their fellows and faced certain doom. They were saved when a sudden tremor toppled a great statue of Myrdmia which crashed down on their foes, killing them to a man. The knights took this as divine intervention and formed an order dedicated to this strange Eastern deity, building a shrine to Myrmidia in the heart of Talabheim. Their devotion to Myrmidia has rendered them virtually immune to fire."

#descr "Theodore Bruckner is a hulking brute of a man known to be inhumanly strong and implacable in dispensing justice at the behest of the ruler of the city of Nuln, Countess Emmanuelle Liebwitz. Theodore holds the position of Headsman and Champion of Nuln and as such as responsible for standing in for the Countess in any trial-by-combat demanded by a member of the aristocracy of that city, as per ancient laws. In this position he has crushed a great many skilled fencers, mercenary swordsmen, and arrogant knights, falling back on his incredible strength and toughness should his not inconsiderable talent with a blade be outdone. Theodore's origins are shrouded in mystery, but it is rumoured he is descended from Norse stock and perhaps his physique bears the touch of Chaos, though none would suggest as much in public. In battle Theodore rides atop the equally unusually massive Demigryph 'Reaper', a beast purchased by the Countess from the Imperial Zoo at exorbitant cost. He is armed with the traditional sword of the Champion of Nuln known as Liarsbane, a powerful Stormlance to use on the charge, and a Baleflame amulet which protects him from hostile magic and, should he fall in battle, will explode into a fireball. Though he is greatly feared and respected, Theodore Bruckner is an executioner, not a leader, of men."

#descr "Aldebrand Ludenhof is the Elector Count of the often overlooked province of Hochland. Being one of the smallest provinces of the Empire and featuring dense forests across much of its land, Hochland has long been used to lacking the political and economic clout of its neighbours. Compounding their reduced presence on the national scale is the fact that Hochland's population is routinely beset by the Greenskins, Beastmen, and bandits that lurk beyond the villages and roadways. Aldebrand is very much the right man for the job, a shockingly tall but thin man with a keen intellect and an always serious and upright character. The Count is noted for his love of hunting, especially falconry, and his incredible knowledge of battle tatics and military strategems. While he may not be the greatest warrior amongst the Electors, the people of Hochland swear he is the greatest leader, assigning almost supernatural abilities to him. In battle Aldebrand is armed with the Runefang of Hochland and also carries a trained hunting falcon."

#descr "Bordering the dangerous and chaos influenced land known as Troll Country, Ostland has always been a rather poor province where life is hard and often cheap, though its people are as a consequence notoriously tough and willing to fight. It is home to many peoples who long ago migrated from the east to seek shelter from the forces of Chaos and is perhaps closer culturally to Kislev than any other province in the Empire. The Raukov family are descended from steppe people and known for their hunting of Chaos marauders and loyalty to the Empire, so when the preceding Elector Count was found to be a follow of Tzeentch it was natural that the foremost scion of the Raukovs took the position. Known as the Black Count for his livery and association with death, Valmir von Raukov has proven to be a notoriously warlike and ruthless military leader, winning many battles against the forces of Chaos and leading punitive raids beyond the borders of Ostland. In battle Valmir wields the Runefang of Ostland but is primarily known for his superb skill with the magical Dragon Bow, even from horseback."

#name "Emperor"
#descr "Karl Franz is the Prince of Altdorf and the current Emperor, elected narrowly over rival candidate Bors Todbringer through the votes of the various Electors. Karl is perhaps the greatest statesman and diplomat the Empire has ever seen and under his rule the greatest of the human realms has recovered and surpassed its former glory. Karl was an intellectual prodigy in his youth, quickly learning any discipline he turned his hand to, be it engineering, music, philosophy, history, or law, but he always knew his true calling was to rule his people not with sheer might, politicking, or religious fervour but with justice and rationality leading the way. In addition to his many academic talents, the Emperor is also a highly skilled general and leader of men and has on numerous occasions proven his own bravery and mettle in combat. Karl Franz rides into battle mounted atop his mighty Griffon 'Deathclaw' armed with the Reikland Runefang and protected by the magic of the Silver Seal."

He is said to have never smiled in his life. His role is to uphold the Emperor's justice during trials of combat. Such trials are a judicial right of high ranking noblemen accused of breaking the Emperor's laws. Ludwig is also the Emperor's bodyguard and his mere presence has so far proven enough to discourage any attempts on the Emperor's life. On the battlefield Ludwig wields the unerring Sword of Justice and carries aloft the Emperor's personal standard. Though Ludwig is no tactician and gives no rousing speeches, the knowledge that he is watching spurs men under his command to feats of bravery. To date Ludwig Schwarzhelm has never been defeated."

#name "Supreme Patriarch"
#descr "Every seven years, the Masters of the eight magical colleges in Altdorf enter a contest of magical might to decide which of them will reign as the Supreme Patriarch. The most recent contest was won by the young and brilliant Patriarch of the Gold College, Balthasar Gelt. Gelt is a mysterious figure, having kept his face concealed by a gold mask for the past decade, but is undeniably a prodigy and is reckoned to be perhaps the most powerful Supreme Patriarch in history. He carries two heirlooms of the Gold College; the Amulet of Sea gold, which protects against hostile magic, and the Cloak of Molten Metal, which protects against missile fire and creates illusionary copies of the mage. As Supreme Patriarch he also wields the Staff of Volans, an ancient and powerful artifact that boosts his already superb magical abilities and allows him to generate magic gems. The rulers of Nuln recently gifted Gelt a pegasus on which he soars over the battlefield, turning the tide with his spells.

#name "Patriarch of the Bright College"
#descr "Every seven years, the Patriarchs and Matriarchs of the eight magical colleges in Altdorf enter a contest of magical might to decide which of them will reign as the Supreme Patriarch for the next seven years. This is an important decision, because the Winds of Magic will blow strongly for the college which supplies the Supreme Patriarch. Thyrus Gormann, Patriarch of the Bright College, held this postition for many years, before being usurped by a young Gold Mage of extraordinary power named Balthasar Gelt. He has taken his loss well and sworn loyalty to Gelt, but his fiery nature ensures he will be first amongst the challengers in the next meeting. In preparation of their rematch Gormann has crafted a magical staff said to contain the tear of an Emperor Dragon which has amplified his pyromantic prowes and granted him the ability to project his magic over great distances and with incredible accuracy. As a fire mage, Gormann is arguably unsurpassed in the Old World.

#spr2 "./Sombre_Warhammer/Warhammer_Empire/Hero_Huss2.tga"
#name "Voice of Sigmar"
#descr "Luthor Huss first came to the attention of the Empire when he roused a small village against a large warband of Beastmen and successfully beat them back, slaying many with his great hammer. When a relief force arrived to defend the village, the young Warrior Priest pursued the Warband alone, tracking them and single handedly taking the head of their Shaman leader. Years of bravely fighting the forces of heresy and Chaos saw Luthor rise to prominence in his order, eventually becoming the representative of the Warrior Priests in the Sigmarite Council in Altdorf. Here Luthor first confronted the Arch-Lectors and accused them of corruption and weakness; an act resulting in his dismissal. Since that day he has travelled the Empire smiting evil and inspiring the people with his great speeches, claiming that battlefield and village are his temple and rejecting the often opulent structures of the Cult of Sigmar. In battle Luthor is surrounded by an aura of spiritual power which tests the courage of any mortal foe trying to strike him, particularly the heretical followers of false gods. As the Voice of Sigmar Luthor spreads the dominion of his God."

Though their goals are rather different the University works closely with the Imperial School of Engineers and at times even the Bright, Grey and Gold Colleges. The University is closely monitored by both the Colleges of Magic and the Sigmarite Faith, for many is the bright young scholar or frustrated academic who has in the past pursued knowledge not meant for mortals and strayed into the world of dark arcana or heresy. Consequently Scholars of Altdorf are more restricted in their studies than those of the University of Nuln. Scholars are neither Wizards nor Engineers, but their knowledge of chemistry, mathematics and philosophy makes them excellent researchers. Scholars have traditionally always flourished in slothful, decadent societies."

The University of Nuln has a long standing rivalry with that of Altdorf and in recent years have extricated itself further from the grip of Sigmarite dogma. This has sparked talk of possible heresy within the walls of the institution, but Countess Emmanuelle von Liebwitz of Nuln has rebuffed all Sigmarite probes in this matter as a threat to her authority.

#descr "The Master Engineers of the Imperial Arsenal are eccentic individuals obsessed with the development and perfection of new weapons with which the Empire might destroy its many foes. They are known to mutter to themselves constantly as they tinker with their contraptions or engage eachother in conversations nonsensical to the common soldier or high ranking noble alike. Despite their unusual and somewhat alarming behaviour Engineers are a boon to the Empire and are the minds behind weapons such as the arbalest, repeater crossbow, and hand crossbow which have been invaluable on the front lines. They are also beloved by the Elector Counts for their knowledge of the construction, defence, and taking of fortifications. On the battlefield a Master Engineer will bring to bear his customised arbalest with attached telescopic sight and explosive bolts and may improve the accuracy of nearby ranged troops by offering them the benefit of complex calculations taking into account humidity, wind, and even something they call the 'curvature' of the land.

Gathering together and clothing themselves in the furs of wolves, the Kin dedicate themselves to the service of Ulric and mete out punishment to Orcs, Beastmen, and other agents of destruction and evil. They fight with a cold, controlled fury, hacking down their foes with axe and sword and rarely taking a step back. Though eager to slay their enemies, the Wolf Kin understand when to stick to the shadows and are adept at guerilla warfare. The Wolf Kin are led on missions of vengeance by Wolf Fathers, veteran kinsman invested with priestly authority by the Temple of Ulric. Ulric grants his followers superior resistance to magic."

#descr "Jerik Wildorn is the founder and Grandmaster of the Hunters of Sigmar. A minor noble who lost his father and older brother to war at a young age, Jerik was largely raised by his family's gamekeeper, who discovered the boy to be a prodigy in woodcraft, hunting and tracking. Jerik formed the Hunters in the aftermath of the Storm of Chaos, recognising that though the main warhost of Archaon was defeated, hundreds of smaller bands remained to raid the countryside while the Empire, it's manpower terribly depleted, struggled to protect even large towns. Jerik wields a great and terrible axe of hatred taken from a Champion of Nurgle and has adorned his helm with the horns of a great Tzaanbull, a Minotaur of Tzeentch, granting him protection from magic."

The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Because of this, comparatively few Light Wizards ever earn the title of Wizard Lord. Those that do are true masters of the arcane who have begun to understand the nature of magic itself and can bend Light energy itself to reproduce facets of the other Lores.

The nature of their mission means Hunters' equipment is often worn from travel and lacking the services of blacksmiths, they often discard pieces of armour damaged in skirmishes.

A Celestial Wizard Lord can see events of the future with unnerving clarity, possesses a keen mind for observation and research, and in battle can call down the very wrath of the heavens."

The symbol of the Sixth Lore is the scythe and the colour of the Order's garb is dark purple or black. Typically pale skinned with Amethyst Wizards are shunned by most folk, associated with death and decay, but the need for knowledge of this darkest Lore of magic is great. A Wizard Lord of the Amethyst College is a fear inspiring avatar of Shyish, capable of severing the souls of his foes and turning them into lifeless husks at his command."

The symbols of the First Lore are many, but chief amongst them is the Serpent of Light and the colour of the Order's robes is white. The wind of Hysh is the purest amongst the Lores, though it is also the most effusive and difficult to master. Light Wizard Lords are beacons of purifying power who often use communions of their fellow mages to direct pure Light magic into the facets of other Lores."

The symbol of the Second Lore is a soaring eagle and the colour of the Order's garb is yellow. The energies of Chamon are heavy and are drawn to pool around metal. Gold Wizard Lords are particularly powerful members of society, as they have mastered many methods of transmutation and inevitably amassed a small personal fortune. The usage of vitriol and acid spells is restricted within the Gold order to Lords as this powerful magic is considered too dangerous for rank and file members. Gold Mages require twice as much gold per month as other mages."

Amber Wizard Lords are even more reclusive and wild than their brothers in the Order and will often go years without any human contact whatsoever.

--------- EVENTS


--the idea here is to write an event for each knightly order which kills off their specific tribute unit and summons the knightly order.
--event one triggers when you have tribute unit X. It kills tribute unit X and summons the order X - GM and their IC. This event can only happen once.
--event two triggers when you have tribute unit X, so can only occur when event one hasn't killed that unit. You get the order knights and a leader but not the GM.

#brief "Middenheim, the City of the White Wolf, is a power within the Empire, the largest and most powerful realm of men in the Old World. It is a land where magic, invention and the courage of mortal men rub shoulders, each an essential weapon in the war against malign powers. The forces of Nordland, Hochland, Ostland, and the allied nation of Kislev align behind the might of Middenheim."
#descr "The Empire is the largest and most powerful of the lands of men in the Old World, a mighty nation that stands as the bulwark against the many enemies of man. It is a land where magic, invention and the courage of mortal men rub shoulders, each an essential weapon in the war against malign powers. The men of the Empire have none of the supernatural strength nor brutal upbringing of the Warriors of Chaos, nor do they boast the numberless ranks of the vile Skaven, the savage resilience of the green-skinned Orcs or uncanny agility of the High Elves. Rather, the men of the Empire rely upon faith, steel, and ingenuity. The Empire is split into many provinces which in theory all hold fealty to the Emperor, but tend to have competing goals. Middenheim, the City of the White Wolf, is the capital of the province of Middenland and the home of the Cult of Ulric. The forces of Nordland, Hochland, Ostland, and the allied nation of Kislev align behind the might of Middenheim."
#summary "Race: Humans.
Military: Medium and heavy infantry with extremely heavy cavalry and dedicated missile units.
Magic: Colleges allow access to all non blood magic but their taxes make labs more expensive.
Priests: Strong."

#descr "Goblins vary wildly in habitat, appearance, and culture, but all are cruel, sneaky, cowardly, and disloyal. A typical Goblin divides his day between committing various malicious acts of thievery and backstabbing, denying their involvement in these acts, or sneaking off. Being physically weak the majority of Goblins hold a permanent position at the bottom of the Greenskin hierarchy, often ending up beaten, eaten, or otherwise mistreated both by the much larger Orcs and their own treacherous kin. Nonetheless since Goblins are ridiculously prolific, easy to boss around, and naturally inclined toward violence, they inevitably make up a large portion of Greenskin armies. Goblin infantry will be armed with whatever weapons and armour they have managed to cobble together, scavenge, or steal, typically something pointy and unpleasant. Amongst any Goblin mob there will some particularly sneaky and vicious members known as Nasty Skulkers, who take the art of 'sticking da pointy bit in da hurty bit' to an extreme, even for Goblins."

A strange purple substance which can induce hallucinations, paranoia, uncontrollable rage, and confusion when it makes contact with a living being, it is applied liberally to the weapons of the bizarre Nightgoblin sect known as the Loons. Loons go to battle wearing full metal helms fashioned into the aspect of the Bad Moon, a symbol they venerate, and are armoured under their robes with precious Dwarf chain links. Loons act as a kind of sacred shock infantry for the Nightgoblins, being much better trained and fiercer warriors than any other of their kind.

#descr "Orcs, also known as Orc Boyz, are the hard-fighting infantry found at the core of most Greenskin tribes. Goblins are more prolific, but it is the Orcs are most associated with the Greenskin species and do the bulk of the bloody work of battle. Orcs are a warrior race and like little more than a good scrap, so this suits them just fine. In fact Orcs so enjoy fighting that when lacking enemies they will happily brawl amongst themselves. Fortunately they are an incredibly resilient race, barely registering pain and blessed with the ability to regrow entire missing limbs if given time. Though they stand a little shorter than a human, Orcs are very broad and well muscled, which suits their headlong charges and brawling style of battle. Orcs are infamous for the crude but deadly 'choppas' they fashion, which they are able to swing with devastating force on the charge. Orc equipment tends to vary greatly depending on available loot, wealth of their tribe, and their ability to win better gear from their fellow orcs in headbutting contests."

Although the incident ended with both Squig and rider impaled on a wickedly sharp stalagtite, the experience was enough to inspire the other Herdas present and a new craze was born. Squig Hoppas are mad in the particular way that some Nightgoblins tend to be and, especially given their horrendous casualty rate, not terribly common. When enough can be mustered by a tribe they generally prove very effective as a sort of bizarre frenetic cavalry capable of inflicting serious damage on even well armoured enemies. Should the rider be slain the Squig will continue to fight, though it will doubtless bound away after the battle."

#name "Nightgoblin Archer"
#descr "Long ago many Goblins took up abode in the caves beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains. Over time they adapted to their new home and became a distinct type, known as Nightgoblins. They are not dissimilar to their surface dwelling cousins, though they have better night vision and wear dark hooded robes to shelter from the painfully bright sun. In temperament Nightgoblins are even more distrustful, sneaky, and cowardly than a typical Goblin, but tend to have better reflexes, honed by a life of sudden death at the teeth and claws of unspeakable cave beasts. Despite their relative weakness, Nightgoblin mobs are feared in battle because they may be hiding a Fanatic, a crazed loon pumped up on strength enhancing magic mushrooms and armed with a massive iron ball and chain. Nightgoblins love to spring ambushes and are notorious for their ability to fill the air, and their foes, with red fletched arrows.

#descr "Some Orcs carry bows. These Orcs, known as Arrer Boyz, are viewed suspiciously by the rest of da Boyz, for archery is a bit 'Gobliny'. As Arrer Boyz can prove their prowess in combat, such oddities can be overlooked. Yelling rude names at Arrer Boyz is a proven way to alleviate camp boredom as the resulting response in the form of a hail of arrows is typically good for starting a big ruckus. Orcs are generally poor shots being both somewhat shortsighted and lacking the patience to aim for long before loosing their arrow, but their bows, though crude, are large and powerful. There is also something to be said for, at the end of the day, being a hulking Orc entirely capable in melee combat when the arrows run out or the enemy reaches their mob."

However in reality Arrer Boyz are far more common amongst Savage Orc tribes, as the use of crude bows is seen as a natural and traditional way to hunt the massive beasts that roam their land. In fact Savage Orc Arrer Boyz tend to be better shots than their northern counterparts, as their magical warpaint enhances their senses in battle. Being Savage Orcs though, they are quick to hurl aside their bows and charge into melee if provoked into a battle frenzy."

#descr "Cave Squigs are found in the bowels of the earth, common in the caverns deep beneath the Worlds Edge Mountains. They are improbable creatures, part animal and part fungus with spheroid bodies, beady eyes, and huge gaping maws filled with razor sharp teeth. Nightgoblins hunt Squigs of all types for various purposes, but the common Cave Squig is primarily used as a living weapon in battle. Once they have been captured by Nettas and beaten into a daze by Clubbas, Cave Squigs are forced into underground stockades and trained by Nightgoblin Herdas, as much as is even possible, to go where directed by the jabs of a long three pronged 'prodda'. Such is the concentration and constant prodding that is required that a team of two Nightgoblin Herdas carrying their oversized prodda can only reliably usher a pair of Cave Squigs toward the enemy, but then again two Squigs can do a lot of damage very quickly indeed. Should the Squigs be slain in battle the Herdas, if they survive, can always fetch more from the stockade, as in reality the 'training' is much more teaching the Nightgoblins how to keep the Squig from eating them than it is in any way changing the behaviour of the Squig."

#name "Stone Troll"
#descr "Trolls are hulking creatures whose hunched appearance belies their powerful nature. These dim witted creatures are eternally hungry and will consume almost anything from rocks and plants to metal or flesh. Not surprisingly their stomachs contain extremely powerful acids which they are known to spontaneously vomit at prey in lieu of beating it to a pulp with a crude club or tearing it apart with their long claws. Trolls are incredibly strong and, though they are quite slow and uncoordinated, truly deadly opponents in battle, but their greatest strength is their ability to regenerate. Trolls can heal any wound entirely in short order and even in the course of seconds or minutes their flesh will knit back together, making the task of killing them very difficult. Stone Trolls, the most common variety of Troll in the North and East of the Old World, have developed both tough protective hides and a resistance to magic. Without the help of Shamanic rituals Stone Trolls can only be found in cave systems and it is fairly rare for the Greenskins to be able to get them to join their armies. On the plus side Stone Trolls are too stupid to require any payment beyond food."

#name "Black Orc"
#descr "Black Orcs are the biggest, meanest, and strongest of all the varieties of Greenskin, a breed that emerged from the East and quickly rose to power across the land. Their name stems from their dark green skin, though it also fits their dour demeaner, for while they are as aggressive and unreasonable as other Orcs, they are grimly and singularly focused on war. Indeed they take war so seriously that they regard even elite formations such as Boar Boy Biguns as frivolous amateurs. Being the best fighters in any Greenskin army, Black Orcs usually end up with the lion's share of loot and pride themselves on meticulously maintaining both heavy armour and quality weapons, something other Greenskins mock when out of earshot. The origins of the Black Orcs are a mystery, but one common tale is they were created by the Chaos Dwarfs as battle slaves and nearly doomed that empire when they inevitably revolted. Black Orcs wade into battle either with a choppa and heavy shield, a massive two handed big choppa, or lighter armour and paired choppas."

Any Orc large and fighty enough to distinguish himself from the bulk of the Boyz in the tribe is known as a Bigun and will have a greater share of the loot and the glory in any battle.

No Orc would be so stupid as to think they could tame an adult Wyvern through force, but Shamans have passed down rituals to call and bind them to the Greenskin cause for generations and occasionally Nightgoblins will steal Wyvern eggs and sell them to powerful Orc leaders to raise from hatchlings as personal mounts.

As such Goblins have ridden wolves in the manner men or elves ride horses for hundreds of years. Goblin Wolf Riders are dangerously fast and, though they should not be expected to do well in prolonged melee, they are quite capable of slaughtering vulnerable targets or encircling the flanks of more powerful foes. They are experts at riding in close pack formation, a great aid in overwhelming their prey. Wolfriders arm themselves with spears, light lances, and bows.

#descr "The Shamans of the Forest Goblin tribes hold a similar level of authority to their Nightgoblin cousins, being essential to many of the tribes rituals. It is the Shamans who extract venom from captured spiders for use in warfare, recreation, and typical Goblin scheming. Forest Goblin Shamans are less willing to perform research than other types of Goblin Shaman, but their connection with nature grants them slightly more magical power. Though they are certainly important to the tribe they are perhaps a little too common for their own good and are not invested with any priestly authority, unlike their elder or Orcish counterparts. Forest Goblin Shamans carry ceremonial wands tipped with venomous spider fangs."

#name "Nightgoblin Shaman"
#descr "Goblin Shamans tend to be considerably less powerful than their Orcish counterparts, being of less immediate interest to Gork and Mork. The Nightgoblins have their own distinct brand of Shamans whose rituals revolve almost entirely around the cultivating, distribution, and consumption of psychadelic magic mushrooms. Because of the vast quantities they consume they are, if anything, even more prone to abject insanity than Orc Shamans. When a Nightgoblin Shaman is in the grips of mania, far from ignoring them like Orcs with their Shamans, their fellow Nightgoblins instead revel and share in theirs frenzied state, gulping down large quantities of distilled fungus brew. Strangely Nightgoblin Shamans are the best equipped to cope with the task of research, as their frequently altered mental state does bring bursts of magical enlightenment."

#descr "Great Shamans are the most powerful of their kind, so clearly marked by Mork and Gork that they are recognised as direct agents of their will. Amongst the Nightgoblins their is no higher status than that of Great Shaman and it is said even Skarsnik, the most famous Nightgoblin Warboss to ever live, would not dare cross one. It is the Great Shamans that preside over the gatherings of Nightgoblin tribes to share in vast cauldrons of fungus brew, it is they who divine the location of Great Cave Squigs to hunt, and it is they who select those who will receive the Madcap mushroom blessing and become Fanatics. In addition to their advanced magical powers, Nightgoblin Great Shamans consume so many magic mushrooms that they can at times speak the will of Mork and Gork directly and so have considerable priestly authority. Indeed they train tiny Squiggly Beasts to follow them around with a bowl of mushrooms they can feast on at any moment. It goes without saying that these habits result in extremely frequent bouts of complete insanity."

Forest Goblin Shamans are less willing to perform research than other types of Goblin Shaman, but their connection with nature grants them more magical power. As Goblins of high social status they inevitably ride to battle mounted on a valuable Giant Spider."

#descr "An Orc Shaman is a sacred living conduit to Gork and Mork and can wield such arcane might that even the crudest Boss cannot help but be impressed. The magics used by Shamans come not only from the Winds of Magic but from the raw energy radiated by any gathering of Greenskins, often becoming overloaded to the point green energy leaks from their eyes and mouth. While Shamans are powerful assets to a tribe and fulfil many vital roles within what passes for Greenskin culture, every Orc knows there's just something 'not right in the ead' about them. Indeed outright madness seems to be a consequence of the constant surges of energy flowing through their minds. It is a common occurence to find an Orc Shaman leaping around howling and behaving an an extremely un-Orcish manner while battle-hardened Biguns and even Warbosses stoically and respectfully pretend not to notice. Orc Shamans focus on darker and more destructive magic than their Goblin counterparts but are even less interested in conducting research."

The magics used by Shamans come not only from the Winds of Magic but from the raw energy radiated by any gathering of Greenskins, often becoming overloaded to the point green energy leaks from their eyes and mouth. The Shamans of Savage Orc tribes are typically a little more spiritual and less destructive than their civilised cousins and while they are just as respected and feared, aren't avoided or ignored in the same manner. Instead they are a more integral part of the tribe's crude culture and take part in social rituals where they apply and bless the warpaint and tattoos of the Boyz to protect them in battle. As such they are less prone to fits of insanity and better able to channel the enthusiastic energy of their tribe into raw elemental power. That said, they are even less interested in conducting research, and activity they see as almost entirely unorcish."

Though far less numerous than lesser Shamans, they are a more common sight than the Great Shamans of Orc or Nightgoblin society as they rise from the much larger Goblin population and are less prone to die from mushroom overdose than their cave dwelling cousins. Goblin Great Shamans adorn themselves with bone and horn taken from great beasts, Trolls, or even Giants felled by their tribe and these bestial fetishes help focus and manage the raw magical energy that courses through them. As such they are barely prone to madness or suddenly exploding at all. On the other hand their magical power is quite variable - Goblins will happily describe any Shaman that shows more power than the typical small tribe mystic as a Great Shaman. Goblin Great Shamans have a degree of priestly authority and are better able to tolerate the boredom of research than their Orcish counterparts."

#descr "Orcs are led by the biggest and brawniest of their kind. These hulking individuals have risen up from the ranks of the Biguns and pummeled their way to the top, defeating the previous Boss in a one-on-one fight and quite possibly killing him. Unlike Goblin Bosses who are defined both by their cunning and knack for doing violence, Orc Bosses got where they are by doing what Orcs love best with little thought to strategy or tactics. That said, a large and violent Orc exerts a natural leadership over his fellows and any who don't follow his typically quite simple orders will catch a stupendous beating. Being the biggest, best, and fightiest Orc Bosses tend to have good quality wargear. While there are Orc Bosses who ascend to no higher station each and every one of them is driven by instinct to try and become a Big Boss and eventually a Warboss, through a simple and proven method - constant warfare. Merely fighting amongst the tribe is not enough, any Boss can do that, it is against the many enemy races which populate the world that a Boss must prove himself to climb the ladder."

While Savage Orcs eschew the gathering of metal arms and armour, a Savage Orc Warboss will adorn himself with equipment made from the bones of particularly savage conquests and draw upon their ferocity in battle. Additionally they will have their pick of the best War Boar stock and as such will ride even larger and more ferocious mounts than their more civilised cousins. From the postion of Warboss there is only one further goal for any Greenskin, to fight and win until they trigger a Waaagh, a covergence of surging energy, enthusiasm for violence, and sheer number of Greenskins that threatens to sweep away entire civilisations."

Additionally they will have their pick of the best War Boar stock and as such will ride even larger and more ferocious mounts than their more civilised cousins. From the postion of Warboss there is only one further goal for any Greenskin, to fight and win until they trigger a Waaagh, a covergence of surging energy, enthusiasm for violence, and sheer number of Greenskins that threatens to sweep away entire civilisations."

Goblins cannot hope to match the physical prowess of Orcs and as such tend to lead tribes of Goblins, but Warbosses can often get even Orc Big Bosses to do their bidding through careful manipulation and a willingness to resort to foul play. As such a Goblin Warboss may be at the head of a considerable and dangerous army where their cunning makes them formidable leaders. A Goblin of such status needs to display his superiority and as such Goblin Warbosses travel everywhere on stylish red chariots drawn by slavering wolves. From the postion of Warboss there is only one further goal for any Greenskin, to fight and win until they trigger a Waaagh, a covergence of surging energy, enthusiasm for violence, and sheer number of Greenskins that threatens to sweep away entire civilisations."

While Black Orcs think little of other Greenskins they are not about to turn down the opportunity to lead so many of their kind on the massive scale of warfare a Waaagh entails. Waaaghbosses are sacred to the Greenskins, for they can truly be said to be enacting the will of Gork and Mork."

#descr "Gobbos are cowardly and disloyal, but nothing stirs their wicked hearts like Grom, mightiest of Goblin Warbosses. Grom was once a fairly ordinary, if perhaps unusually aggressive, Goblin Boss in the Broken Axe tribe, but everything changed when he consumed, upon a dare, a mass of raw Troll flesh. As Troll flesh regenerates and Grom, always a big eater, had not stopped to cook the meal, this appeared to be a suicidal course of action. Yet Grom did not perish, even as the foul meat writhed and thrashed in his belly, and a race between his ability to digest and the flesh's ability to regrow began in earnest. After a full day and night of terrible pain, Grom emerged from his tent a changed Goblin - grown to prodigious size, granted great strength, and able to regenerate his own wounds even more quickly than a Troll. Unsurprisingly Grom soon became Warboss of his own tribe, then conquered the surrounding tribes, personally slaying several Orc Warbosses who severely underestimated this massive Goblin. To Goblins Grom was now a living God, for he was everything they were not, and he strived to live up to his legend, setting his sights overseas on the Elven land of Ulthuan to prove his kind could overcome their ancestral fear of the 'pointy ears'. Grom rides into battle atop his custom War Chariot, armed with his infamous axe Elfbiter, and engenders surprising courage and fervour in his followers, the bulk of which are always Goblins. As a legendary Warboss, Grom may trigger a vast Waaagh in his name by engaging in battle."

The crown whispered fell plans to Azhag and the Orc took to wearing it always, finding success after success as a result of following its machinations. Always the crown spoke of further triumphs, greater ambitions, and Azhag sought them willingly. Though he was prone to use unorcish words, had little tolerance for the typical infighting of his kind, and seemed to be 'not quite right in da 'ead', Greenskins flocked to his banner. As he grew in power the demands of the crown increased though, as it cajoled and manipulated him Southward, seeking to reunite with its original owner. Possessing a brutish and stubborn mind, the Warboss would often resist, standing still in a stupor while battling internally for control of his actions. The only time the two minds work entirely in conjunction is during battle, as Azhag's instincts for violence perfectly complement both the crown's clever plans and the destructive sorcery it granted to its hulking host. In battle Azhag rides atop his personal War Wyvern Skullmuncha and in addition to the dread crown equips himself with magical blades and charmed armour. Though highly unusual, Azhag is nonetheless an Orc Warboss in his prime and may trigger a great Waaagh by engaging in battle."

Wyverns are apex predators that live high in the barren reaches of the World's Edge Mountains, although they will range far from their bone strewn lairs to devastate villages and farms. When Greenskins see the menacing silhouette of a Wyvern circling high above they greet it with whoops and cheers, for an instinctual kinship is felt between these destructive beings, and Orcs see Wyverns as manifestations of the proper order of the strong imposing their will on the weak. No Orc would be so stupid as to think they could tame an adult Wyvern through force, but occasionally Nightgoblins will steal Wyvern eggs and sell them to powerful Orc leaders to raise from hatchlings as personal mounts. This Orc Warboss has such a mount and the pair make for a force of sheer destruction on the battlefield. Like any Warboss there is a chance this one may, through joining in battle, become the leader of a great Waaagh."

#name "Orc Waaaghboss"
#descr "This Warboss has reached the zenith of Greenskin achievement and triggered a Waaagh, a massive confluence of Greenskin energy and destruction with the power to topple civilisations. If Greenskins kept history books his place would be firmly secured therein, but sadly they do not. Other races do, and provided they survive the looting and destruction that accompanies the waaagh, they're sure to mention the leader of that green tide. Waaaghbosses are sacred to the Greenskins, for they can truly be said to be enacting the will of Gork and Mork."

The Dwarf Lord's son, Kazrik, was not taken captive but was shaved, tattooed with Gorfang's personal glyph and firmly nailed to Kazador's own throne.

In battle Gorfang wields the massive serrated choppa Red Fang with incredible speed and is protected by a huge shield cut from the great doors of Karak Azul and the magical Evil Sun Armour.

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! The Greenskins mod has a central mechanic which make this nation a little different from others.

Each of your military leaders (Goblin Boss, Nightgoblin Boss, Orc Boss, Black Orc Big Boss) will be 'promoted' when they reach a certain amount of experience points. This will add the term 'Rising' to their name, e.g. 'Orc Boss Rising', but they will otherwise be unchanged. Any 'Rising' Boss, Big Boss, or Warboss has a chance each turn to trigger an event which will transform them to the next tier of military commander and grant them some free troops. This transformation will also remove most of their gained experience, allowing them to earn it and become 'Rising' once more. Only one of these promotion events can happen in each province in each turn.

The intention here is to encourage you to actively use your military commanders in combat and level them up, eventually reaching the hallowed status of Waaaghboss. So get stuck in!

For Northern Greenskins nation the progressions are as follows:

Goblin Boss -> Goblin Big Boss -> Goblin Warboss -> Goblin Waaaghboss
Nightgoblin Boss -> Nightgoblin Big Boss -> Nightgoblin Warboss -> Nightgoblin Waaaghboss
Orc Boss -> Orc Big Boss -> Orc Warboss -> Orc Waaaghboss

---------------- WELCOME TO GREENSKINS SOUTH -----------------

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! The Greenskins mod has a central mechanic which make this nation a little different from others.

Each of your military leaders (Goblin Boss, Forest Goblin Boss, Orc Boss, Savage Orc Boss) will be 'promoted' when they reach a certain amount of experience points. This will add the term 'Rising' to their name, e.g. 'Orc Boss Rising', but they will otherwise be unchanged. Any 'Rising' Boss, Big Boss, or Warboss has a chance each turn to trigger an event which will transform them to the next tier of military commander and grant them some free troops. This transformation will also remove most of their gained experience, allowing them to earn it and become 'Rising' once more. Only one of these promotion events can happen in each province in each turn.

The intention here is to encourage you to actively use your military commanders in combat and level them up, eventually reaching the hallowed status of Waaaghboss. So get stuck in!

For Southern Greenskins nation the progressions are as follows:

Goblin Boss -> Goblin Big Boss -> Goblin Warboss -> Goblin Waaaghboss
Forest Goblin Boss -> Forest Goblin Big Boss -> Forest Goblin Warboss -> Forest Goblin Waaaghboss
Orc Boss -> Orc Big Boss -> Orc Warboss -> Orc Waaaghboss
Savage Orc Boss -> Savage Orc Big Boss -> Savage Orc Warboss -> Savage Orc Waaaghboss"

#brief "There is no race so pervasive, prolific, diverse, and destructive as the Greenskins.

The Greenskins of the North and East count the bizarre cave dwelling Nightgoblins and militaristic Black Orcs among their number."

#summary "Race: Sneaky Goblins, madcap Nightgoblins, brutish Orcs, militaristic Black Orcs, and voracious Trolls.
Military: Hordes of cowardly Goblins, swift Wolfriders, tough Orc Boyz, hard charging Boar Riders, and well equipped Black Orcs. Discounts to recruitment in lands of turmoil.
Magic: Fire, Nature, Death, and Earth. Mages may be recruited without a lab.
Priests: Poor.
Mechanics: Bosses with enough XP can upgrade to Big Boss, Warboss, and finally trigger a Waaagh, getting free troops each time."

#descr "The Silverin Guard are the traditional guardians of the Watchstone of Tor Yvresse, a waystone of great power and an essential part of the arcane network maintaining the stability of the Great Vortex which protects the world from an overwhelming wave of Chaos. Their arms and armour are constructed with techniques dating from the time shortly after the Great Chaos Incursion and bear enchantments which, though faded from their glorious past, still function to aid them in battle against supernatural beings and resist hostile magic. In recent centuries the threats posed to the High Elves have grown so many and powerful and the losses the Asur suffer in defence of their homeland so severe that the Silverin Guard have been freed from their purely defensive duties and can now be found reinforcing the armies raised by Nobles and Princes. The Silverin fight in the manner of the ancients, forming a phalanx of long spears and relying on their heavy armour and superior discipline to break down the foe. Their shields depict the sun rising over Tor Yvresse and the knowledge that light always follows from even the darkest times.

Those woodsmen who are proven worthy, form an elite bodyguard, armed with terrible long handled Chracian Axes. The White Lions are often sent to join armies, protecting generals and mages, or bolstering the strength of the army. They are renowned for their unflinching courage in the face of overwhelming odds and horrors. Their White Lion cloaks act as execellent shields while their two handed axes are swung with terrible force.

#descr "While the lions that stalk the lands of Chrace are savage creatures that must often be hunted down for the safety of the Chracian populace, the High Elves take no joy in needless slaughter and should they discover lion cubs having slain their mother the warriors of Chrace take them in and raise them by hand. These lions become as loyal as griffons and form a bond with the Chracian warriors, serving alongside them in the armies of Ulthuan. Some are used to pull the famed Lion Chariots of Chrace, but others are sent into battle in War Prides. War Lions are surprisingly intelligent and capable of following simple orders given on special whistles. Though they are 'tame' their ferocity in battle in undiminished. Chracians take great care over the wellbeing of their animals and are fond of braiding their long manes and decorating them with golden torques.

#name "Sword Master of Hoeth"
#descr "The Sword Masters are exemplars of the martial arts, capable of incredible feats of arms. At the White Tower of Hoeth, these ascetic warrior monks train ardously, honing their exceptional agility, mastering every nuance and facet of sword fighting. Each Sword Master has studied warfare and personal combat for decades, often centuries - developing an expertise so incredibly complete that there is no group of warriors that can match them. These devotees of the sword devote themselves to the worship of Hoeth in no lesser manner than those who study High Magic, learning to control their bodies and their minds through meditation and exercise. They wield the Greatswords of Hoeth, elegantly shaped swords, often six feet from the pommel to the tip. Swordmasters are skilled and quick enough to cut and deflect missiles with their blades, just as they parry strikes in melee.

Any who look upon them will know the past and the future, and will forever be cursed with knowledge of their own death. The Phoenix Guards do not utter a word, having taken a magical wov to not speak of the secrets of time. Until one has witnessed the Phoenix Guard upon the field of battle, one can not comprehend the power they posses, utterly silent, the air around them shimmering. They are the chosen warriors of their god and sacred. Knowing their fate, they do not flinch from any horror and fight with utter resolve.

They are brave horsemen, able to live of the land and away from supply routes. They strike fast and hard, vanishing into the wilderness. They form an important part of High Elf armies, being able to patrol ahead of the main force, intercepting enemy scouts an hunting down lone enemies or warmachines.

Today, even though their skill and pride are much the same, the aristocracy of Caledor ride Elven steeds as knights and are colloquially known as the 'Dragon Princes' in honour of their forebears, though their number is largely made up of lesser nobles. They still wear armor forged in a volcano's heart, enchanted in ancient ways. This dragon armor is entirely resistant to flames. In battle the Princes seek glory and worthy opponents, often seeking out the most dangerous assignments.

They are always among the first to answer a call to war and foremost are their nobles, fighting from swift war chariots. They fight with skill and bravery, the speed of the Elven steeds complementing their sleek yet powerful chariots. When they charge, they crash fearlessly into their foes, thrusting with sharp spears and running foes over. The charioteers are sometimes called Riders of the Wind, when amassed in larger forces.

#descr "While the lions that stalk the lands of Chrace are savage creatures that must often be hunted down for the safety of the Chracian populace, the High Elves take no joy in needless slaughter and should they discover lion cubs having slain their mother the warriors of Chrace take them in and raise them by hand. These lions become as loyal as griffons and form a bond with the Chracian warriors, serving alongside them in the armies of Ulthuan. Some lions are trained to pull chariots similar to those used by the Knights of Tiranoc. These Lion Chariots are crewed with seasoned White Lion warriors armed with their deadly Chracian longaxes and while they lack the momentum and crushing headlong charge of the Tiranoc Chariots, they are devastatingly powerful in close combat. Should the charioteers be slain the lion will continue to fight on and can be deployed as a War Lion after the battle.

Those who did not became the Shadow Warriors. They fought from hiding against the Dark Elves in a blood soaked land. They eventually became masters of guerilla warfare, striking with deadly accuracy from the shadows. Today they are the most sinister and brutal of all the High Elves, and bound to their bitter duty with ancient oaths. Their hatred knows no bounds when it comes to the Dark Elves, but their wrath for any foe is terrible. They go before the armies of Ulthuan wherever they go, killing and clearing way for the main force. They have learned to predict enemy missile fire and avoid it.

#descr "Rangers are High Elf warriors who hail from the more remote parts of Ulthuan and maintain a martial tradition distinct to the citizen militia of the more populous areas. Instead, they hone their personal fighting skills in smaller training bands, coming together in times of need to fight alongside their metropolitan counterparts. Thus the skillset and garb of the High Elf Ranger differs from most, often donning lighter armour to enable swifter movement across terrain and to facilitate the greater freedom of movement required to wield two swords at once. Often coming from more insular communities that have suffered at the hands of raiders, High Elf Rangers can be bitter, haughty, and proud, but have a well-deserved reputation as some of the most steadfast warriors of the Asur, particularly when it comes to defence of their lands against their hated cousins the Dark Elves.

#descr "The Navy of Ulthuan is known to be the mightiest in the world, challenged only by that of their dark brethren in Naggraroth, and the greatest symbol of this naval power is the Eagle Claw Bolt Thrower. These finely wrought and magically enchanted ballistae are capable of unleashing multiple large bolts in a single shot with shocking precision. The Eagle Claws mounted on their ships are far too large for the Lothern Sea Guard to deploy in land battles, but they have developed a miniaturised version which they mount on a chariot similar in design to those used in Tiranoc. The crew are lightly armed and armoured and should not be expected to perform in melee, but the additional ranged power the Eagle Claw brings to bear is highly valued by High Elf commanders.

#descr "There are regions of Avelorn that the citizen soldiers are forbidden to enter. Some are sacred places of power, linked with the rites of renewal the Everqueen performs to sustain Uthuan and her people. Others are drk and dangerous places from which the touch of Chaos never fully faded. It is the duty of the Sisters of Avelorn to watch over such places, to protect them, or to protect others from them. The Sisters are an entirely female force of highly skilled archers, selected from the ranks of the citizen soldiery by the Handmaidens of the Everqueen for their skill and strength of character alike. The Sisters are taught to pursue perfection in everything they do and, both elevated beyond the petty intrigues of Ulthuan social standing and given the Everqueen as an unblemished idol, they do exactly that, be it martial, aristic, or spiritual. The Sisters of Avelorn prefer to fight their battles at long range, as they are granted spectral bows which fire mystical bolts of white-blue flame that sears tainted flesh and bone alike. Yet they are nearly as skilled in close combat, where they put a paired blade and dagger to lethal use. The Sisters are sacred to the people of Ulthuan.

#descr "The White Tower of Hoeth is the seat of High Elf magical learning. Hoeth, the Lord of Wisdom and Knowledge, is the Elven god of learning and sorcery. Although one of the Elvish pantheon and held in esteem by all of the Asur, Hoeth does not have much of a priesthood nor an organized system of churches in Ulthuan, save at the White Tower of Hoeth. There the greatest loremasters and mages in the world strive to perfect their mastery of the sorcerous arts. It is a place of wonders unbounded, where mages strive to harness every aspect of magic. Their knowledge is vast and their breadth of knowledge unsurpassed. In times of strife, the mages of Hoeth join the armies, sometimes commanding entire armies themselves. With skill derived from through centuries of ardous study they deflect the spells of the enemy, while directing the destructive fires of Asuryan against the foe. They can reach farther than most mages when conducting rituals."

#descr "Vaul's Anvil is a shrine of Vaul, the Elven god of smithing, which is situated in the heart of a volcano on the last island of the Dragon Spine. During the Great Chaos Invasion, Aenarion the Defender and Caledor Dragontamer travelled to the Anvil to construct the Great Weapons that would be used to fight the forces of Chaos. The knowledge of making these Great Weapons was lost along with the Hammer of Vaul, but the sites is still used by the Smith Priests of Vaul to make magic items of no small power. The god Vaul was chained and blinded in a eon long war with Khaine, and his priests blind themselves to prove their devotion. The Smith Priests are dedicated to their craft and their training is devoted to crafting alone. Despite their blindness, they can make items far beyond their magic skill in other areas, but their preference for elaborate forging do not make them particularly efficient."

#descr "The Tower of Hoeth is home to many disciplines of art, war, magic and learning. Most students and masters confine themselves to one path, and seek to master that path. A select few accomplish several and even fewer master all arts. Those who do are called Loremasters. Even the martial disciplines seem easy to them and their magical knowledge is broad. Their brilliant intellects make them sublime strategists and warriors, able to thread together many nuances and ideas to insights beyond most mortals. Invariably, in times of strife, they seek battle, to better understand, and they excel at this intuitive use of magic. Meanwhile performing rituals, conducting magical research, and forging, while easy to them, is seen as uninteresting work beneath their genius. While Loremasters have considerable knowledge of the magic of death and the wilds, they regard these disciplines as somewhat unsavory or crude arcana best left to the pages of their scholarly works, rather than seeking to apply them in war."

They form an important part of High Elf armies, being able to patrol ahead of the main force, intercepting enemy scouts an hunting down lone enemies or warmachines. The more experienced Reavers are called Harbingers. Nobles of Ellyria often eschew the more typical path of battle as heavy cavalry in the manner of the Silver Helms and instead go to war as the Reavers do, striking quickly and secretly with bow or blade."

#descr "The grim Shadow Warriors hail from a terrible time, when the land of Nagarythe was riven with civil war. Most of the populace sided with the Witch King and became Dark Elves. Those who did not became the Shadow Warriors. They fought from hiding against the Dark Elves in a blood soaked land. They eventually became masters of guerilla warfare, striking with deadly accuracy from the shadows. Today they are the most sinister and brutal of all the High Elves, and bound to their bitter duty with ancient oaths. Their hatred knows no bounds when it comes to the Dark Elves, but their wrath for any foe is terrible. They go before the armies of Ulthuan wherever they go, killing and clearing way for the main force. Shadow Walkers are the leaders of cadres of Shadow Warriors and are appointed by the group based on their talent for slaying Dark Elves, not their authority or nobility, an unusual arrangement in the Ulthuan military. As such they make capable commanders, but only of smaller forces. Such is their talent in warring with the hated foe that they have learned to predict enemy missile fire and avoid it with barely a thought."

#fixedname "Alith Anar"
#descr "Alith Anar, Prince of Nagarythe, known to many as the Shadow King is the current ruler of the Kingdom of Nagarythe and the last member of the noble line of House Anar. Tradition maintains that the remaining loyalists of Nagarythe chose House Anar to lead them in the terrible times following the retreat of the Witch King Malekith into the west. Alith Anar is perhaps the most vengeful and feared of his line, having spent much of his life rooting out traitors and spies across Ulthuan and personally ending their lives, as well as leading punitive raids across the sea into the lands of Naggaroth itself. High Elves are typically not known to forgive easily but have a strong sense of honour which prevents them fulling embracing a war of terror and retribution: not so the Shadow King who knew the power of putting fear into the hearts of his foes with tales of his merciless vengeance. Alith Anar carries the Stone of Midnight, an item stolen from Morathi herself which shrouds him in shadows and renders him difficult to strike with mundane weapons. He is armed with the deadly Moonbow, said to have been crafted by the Goddess Lileath herself, which strikes fear into those who suffer its streaking arrows, and atop his brow sits the symbol of absolute authority over Nagarythe, the Shadow Crown, which makes the world seem slow and predictable to its wearer."

His loyalty and integrity is legendary, and this has earned him many friends even beyond the borders of Ulthuan.

In return for these services, he has been rewarded with the Pelt of Charandis, a magnificient enchanted cloak that protects Korhil from spears, arrows and poison."

#newspell
#copyspell "Summon Leogryphs"
#name "Summon Unicorns of Avelorn"
#descr "The Unicorns that inhabit the forests and glades of Avelorn and a few other select locations within Ulthuan are famously aloof, but in times of dire need they can brought to the service of Elvenkind by mages sufficiently blessed in the nature magic of Ghyran. Unicorns resemble horned horses superficially but this belies their magical nature and not inconsiderable strength and intellect. They are incredibly swift and able to deal terrible damage with their magical horns when charging into the fray. The Unicorns of Ulthuan are somewhat more civilised and less vindictive than their cousins in the dark woods of Athel Loren and have lost the aura of unease and fear those creatures project, but are still able to heal themselves with their innate magic. The Priestesses of Isha are known for their ability to summon these reclusive creatures in defence of the realm."

In some tales it was Talyn, King of the Eagles, who bore Ereth Khial, Goddess of the Underworld, to her ashen home at Asuryan's command. Like the High Elves, Great Eagles are haughty creatures of considerable intelligence and pride. By way of a ritual passed down through the generations a mage can formalise the ancient alliance by bonding a noble Great Eagle with a Prince of the High Elf aristocracy. The two will fight as one until their death, acting as both a general with a bird's eye view of battle and a terrifyingly swift and powerful combatant capable of attacking the enemies rear ranks."

#descr "The origins of the High Elves are rooted in the nativity of the World. They were once the greatest and most powerful race in the whole world and their actions shaped history. Now their people are in decline, but still they fight on resolutely. For their diminishing race to survive, the High Elves must possess an army of unequalled skill. To this end all High Elves are taught from an early age to master the sword, spear and bow. Citizen soldiers form the core of their armies, while those completely devoted to the martial arts rank among the most fearful warriors in the old world. The High Elves were the first race to study magic and remain the greatest masters in the known world. Their magic is a siphon to chaos, and their skills in controlling, shaping and, when needed, draining magic are unsurpassed."
#summary "Race: High Elves, long lived, graceful and magically skilled.
Military: Very skilled infantry, archers and cavalry, strong elite troops, all very expensive.
Magic: Very strong Astral and Fire, strong Air and Nature, some Water and Earth. Researchers better in Magic scales. Versatile forging.
Priests: Average.
Mechanics: Halved upkeep on non-sacred military. Mercenaries cost 25% more."
#brief "An ancient race, the High Elves protect the world from the malign influence of Chaos. Their martial skills are rivalled only by their mastery of magic. Their excellence is a necessity, for the elves are few and the powers needed to sustain their wards are great."

The leader of these Skinks was Tehenhauin, prophet of Sotek and a skink of extraordinary size. Tehenhauin and his followers went on to spread the Cult of Sotek across Lustria, exterminating countless Skaven. Entirely immune to all manner of poisons and considerably more aggressive than their fellows, the Red Crested Skinks won countless battles against the ratmen and spawned in unprecedented numbers. With the growing power of the Cult of Sotek, seething hosts of Red Crested Skinks are an increasingly important part of the Lizardman war effort."

Kroxigor are given heavy weapons with which they smash their foes in battle, dealing collossal damage. As with the Saurus they are also more than capable of killing with their razor sharp teeth. The scaly skin of the Kroxigor is capable of deflecting even axe and sword blows and they are notoriously hard to kill. They are best employed against large foes or heavily armoured enemy elites and will not fare so well against a throng of lesser foes."

They prey on the various giant insects which swarm across their territory, particularly relishing the taste of the horse-sized Bale Wasp. The Razordon's favoured method of hunting is to wait in the mire with only its nostrils poking out then ambush its prey by suddenly convulsing, lashing its tail forward and launching a deadly volley of barbed spines. The Razordon then springs forth to crush its prey in its powerful jaws and swallow great hunks of it down whole. Skink handlers have learned to harness these aggressive but stealthy creatures in war, where their barbs are as deadly as crossbow bolts and their thick spined hide as tough as armour. Unlike their fire breathing cousins Razordons are not truly amphibious but are still strong swimmers and can cross rivers with relative ease."

Unable to bear the weight of a Saurus warrior, Horned Ones nontheless make excellent mounts for the more warlike Skinks of the Southlands and are often used in stealthy raids.

In battle they unleash a terrible scream like the hissing of a thousand angry serpents and their mere presence can cause widespread panic.

#descr "The god of vengeance, spite and blood, Sotek announced his birth with a flood of a million serpents boiling up from the dense underbrush of Lustria, a torrent of venomous hate which finally forced the ratmen of Pestilens from the land. Ever since that moment the priests of Sotek have summoned these poisonous snakes by spilling sacrificial blood and invoking his name. It is a practice which deeply concerns many of the Slann and their followers, but there is no doubting its effectiveness in battle."

The obsinite weapons they wield may seem crude, but they are as deadly as any forged of steel. Saurus get tougher and more ferocious as they age and by the time they gain the title Scar Veteran they have undoubtedly seen hundreds of battles. Scar Veterans are trusted to lead small forces of troops and are formidable fighters, certainly more than a match for the champions of younger races."

One in every few hundred Skinks, still a huge number in all, is spawned to serve the Slann in a more direct capacity, as a Priest. These Skinks are larger and bolder than their fellows and command a degree of respect even amongst the Saurus and Kroxigor, for they are the eyes of the Slann. Skink Priests generally attend to minor rituals and observances, though with fewer and fewer active Slann, their role in the plan of the Old Ones is increasing. Every Priest is attuned to the magical presence of the Slann and lends his power in battle through a constant communion."

Sotek is not an Old One, though the rise of the serpent god of blood and vengeance was foretold by the Slann, who have yet to even acknowledge the Cult. Whether the Slann will ever take action against the followers of Sotek is unclear, but in the mean time their power grows. More and more spawnings show Sotek's influence and Skink Priests of Sotek are now a common sight, preaching a coming time of vengeance and making sacrifices to sate the thirst of the serpent God. Priests of Sotek are immune to poison and have dominion over snakes, indeed they have taken to using deadly poisonous jungle vipers as a means of protection. They have some skill in blood magic in addition to their native minor magic. Priests of Sotek are not naturally attuned to the communion of the Slann.

Chameleon Skinks are known to have remained in place for hours on end awaiting the perfect ambush and even in open ground they are virtually impossible to see clearly. It had been so long since the last spawning of these Skinks that they were thought to be lost forever, but in these recent years of war, they have begun to spontaneously spawn across Lizardman territory, a sign from the Old Ones that the Slann have yet to decipher.

It is also extremely vulnerable to any form of attack, however it will recover from any afflictions sustained and will require little in the way of upkeep."

Nakai bears the marking of the Old Ones and albino colouration. His gnarled scales and spined ridges are crisscrossed with the scars of a thousand battles and his demise has been reported numerous times, but the Old Ones have a special plan for Nakai and he always returns to aid his people. It is believed Nakai was one of the first Kroxigor to spawn in Itza; he fought in numerous battles in the Great War against Chaos, reputedly slaying a Greater Daemon in single combat. Nakai's appearance at a temple city often precedes an invasion, but no city has fallen under his watch and he is considered one of the clearest signs that the Old Ones still favour their children. Nakai carries a great Daemon slaying obsinite club of incredible power and wears a pair of twinned bracers which grant him immunity to fire and cold."

Tiktaqto swoops into battle mounted on his particularly large and fearsome Terradon, Zwup, the two fighting as one in perfct harmony. The Master of Skies is granted two powerful artifacts by the Mage Priests; the Mask of Heavens and the Blade of Ancient Skies. The Mask grants Tiktaqto power over the air itself and provides protection against both enemy missiles and hostile magic. The Blade is constructed from the jawbone of an ancient aerial predator and has been enchanted to bite deep through almost any armour."

It is he that protects the most powerful of the Slann while they meditate, often for decades or even centuries, in the Eternity Chamber of the First City. Chakax is the last surviving member of his spawning and possibly the oldest of all Temple Guard. His skills are commensurate with his age and he has destroyed both lone assassins and entire regiments in his countless years of vigil, not once losing a Slann under his protection. He wields the Star Stone Mace, a weapon of material not quarried on this world which can negate magical forces with ease. The Helm of the Prime Guardian sits on his head, granting him visions of any who would dare attempt to harm his charges and around his muscled neck hangs the Eternity Key, an artefact that grants Chakax incredible, tireless speed in battle."

He is the rock upon which the enemy break, an immovable warrior immune to fear or doubt, covered with thick scales and corded muscle. Gor Rok is blessed by all the Old Ones and so fated for great things, granted great fortune in battle and held as sacred by the Lizardmen. As befits a sacred champion Gor Rok is equipped with the finest artefacts available, smiting his foes with the unerring Mace of Ulumak and halting even charging daemons with the Shield of Aeons. This solid obsidian shield was forged by Adohi Tegha himself in the heart of a volcano and for any other creature would be far too heavy to lift."

The vile ratmen somehow overcame the disease, flora and fauna of Lustria and became agents of corruption, releasing plagues which devastated the Lizardman population. Cahqua and her resident Slann were ravaged by pestilence and Tehenhauin, sensing the city was doomed, gathered the sacred golden plaques and led the survivors into the jungle. These plaques spoke of the arrival of vengeful Sotek and Tehenhauin, sacrificing thousands of captured ratmen with his serpent blade, acted as his herald. As Prophet of Sotek Tehenhauin is able to unleash wave after wave of poisonous blood red snakes in battle."

As the great temple city of Pahuax fell, Oxyotl fought bravely to defend his Lord the Slann Mage-Priest Pocaxalan who unleashed an incantation supposed to blast the daemons back to their realm. Unfortunately even the great Slann could not control such magical power and the centre of the city vanished in a blinding flash of light. Oxyotl awoke to find himself in the nightmarish Realm of Chaos, scant paces away from daemons feasting on the remains of his Lord. None know how Oxyotl survived his daemonic pursuers, but he found his way back to Lustria only to realise over seven thousand years had passed. His return coincided with the first spawning of Chameleon Skins in memory and with his golden blowpipe he once again began to hunt those who would disrupt the Great Plan."

#era 2
#brief "The Lizardmen were created by the Old Ones, divine interstellar beings of unimaginable power. For thousands of years they have tended to the will of these beings and protected the world from Chaos."
#descr "The Lizardmen are a race of reptillian servants created by the Old Ones thousands of years ago. A servant race, they exist only to enact the Great Plan of the Old Ones. The Old Ones brought with them the First Generation of Slann and spawned four more generations to rule over the warlike Saurus, nimble Skinks and mighty Kroxigor. However a Great Catastrophe struck the world and heralded the arrival of Chaos at the poles; since that time the Old Ones have been absent. In their stead, the Lizardmen stand as guardians against Chaos and shape the world according to the Great Plan. Largely isolated in Lustria, the Lizardmen have watched and waited for a time when Chaos might be defeated and the world restored for the glorious return of their masters. Countless years of divination and consultation with the stars has revealed that time to be now and with the Awakening God the lizardmen shall set the world right once again."
#summary "Race: Cold blooded lizard people ruled by ancient Slann. Prefer heat scale +2.
Military: Skink skirmishers, savage Saurus warriors, and large jungle creatures. Sacred Temple Guard only recruitable in the presence of a Slann.
Magic: Extremely powerful Astral, Nature and Elemental magic with a separate path into Blood.
Priests: Very Powerful."

#descr "Ogres don't have much use for the weapons of smaller humanoids like Orcs, Elves, Dwarfs and Men, so they allow scrounging Gnoblars to squabble over their possessions. A particularly crafty Gnoblar proclaiming himself King of Scrap recently pioneered a crude war machine based on the Stone Throwers of Dwarf clans which gives all these weapons back, pointy end first. The Scraplauncher does what the name implies: it launches bundles of weapons and other scrap metal across the battlefield to rain down on the heads of the enemy. It is crewed by bickering Gnoblars and hauled by a foul tempered but somewhat oblivious Rhinox. While the Gnoblar crews and thir ill-tempered mount are as fractious and undisciplined as you might expect, the King of Scrap has appointed a Gnoblar of uncommon intelligence to captain each Scraplauncher and as such they can be relied upon to obey orders. Should the Rhinox be badly hurt, it will undoubtedly shake off the ramshackle Scraplauncher and stampede over friend and foe.

Pitfighters are young Bulls whose bloodlust could not be contained by the tribe and were handed over to the Butchers. As the Pitfighters live only to kill, the Butchers replace their arms with brutal Stumpblades and hammer an assortment armour directly into their flesh. Pitfighters live their short lives only to honour and feed the Maw and as such are sacred to the Ogre Kingdoms.

Many are the Tyrants who have perished trying to subdue one of these behemoths, but occasioanlly a particularly powerful Ogre may manage to capture one and brand it with his mark. Slavegiants are goaded into battle with pointed stakes, but usually it doesn't take much goading, as the Giant is all too willing to take out the humiliation of being enslaved on any creature smaller than himself. In battle Slave Giants attack by stomping, whipping their heavy chains about and generally causing utter chaos and carnage.

#descr "A Bruiser is second only to the Tyrant in terms of strength and aggression and they are often related to the kingdom's ruler. Bruisers are chieftains of a sort, but generally act as enforcers who keep order rather than actual leaders. Bruisers are without exception physically more powerful than the common Bulls of the tribe and are often champions of the Ogre games that help define their social organisation. Unlike champions and leaders of other races, Bruisers are not hard to replace; if a Bruiser within the tribe is slain he will be replaced almost instantly by the next strongest Ogre, who will get first dibs on his stuff. As Ogres of some status, Bruisers wear heavy fur cloaks and a patchwork of stolen armour, however they favour crude clubs over choppas or ironfists, as they are better for keeping the Bulls in line. Ogres are not an especially cunning race, but they seem to have an innate talent when it comes to tracking and collecting 'protection' money from the local population.

Whether because of their freebooting past, numerous successful pit fights or simply evolutionary process, Tyrants are surprisingly skilled fighters and this, coupled with their sheer strength and cunning, makes them some of the most dangerous creatures in the known world. Ogres are not an especially cunning race, but they seem to have an innate talent when it comes to tracking and collecting 'protection' money from the local population. Only Tyrants have the force of will and martial authority to get the typically nomadic Ogres to construct proper fortifications. Though they have reached the pinnacle of power and status within their own tribe, Tyrants seek to constantly prove their might to others and to gain a Big Name; a title which marks them out as an Ogre of note in what passes for the history of their kind.

This Tyrant is known for his connection to the Great Maw, having personally made the pilgrimage there and returned with a portion of its ravenous hunger.

They arm themselves not only with the traditional club but with a deadly harpoon, suitable for hunting their massive prey. Such is the Hunter's connection with the wilderness and the stark rock of the mountains that they are effectively shamanic figures able to manipulate the Winds of Magic, though they have absolutely no interest in magical research.

#descr "Mawguts are corpulent hulks, former Slaughtermasters who took in the flesh of the Great Maw and became host to one of its infinite mouths. The guts of these bloated creatures have split asunder, revealing a ravenous maw full of jagged teeth. The maw will violently consume anything within reach, be it a fully armoured soldier, a warhorse, a bull ogre or even the hands of its host body. Beyond the ring of teeth and crushing muscle lies a hellish portal that leads to the impossible depths of the Great Maw itself. Smaller enemies are thus easily devoured one after another, while larger foes face being eaten a chunk at a time. These terrifying, mindless eating machines will devour eighty men a month and cause widespread panic until slain; no easy task given the regenerative abilities they have gained from the mawflesh. Near tireless in battle and protected by fetid layers of condensed fat, Mawguts can even devour hostile magic."

The Mawfiends, as they are known, are the undisputed rulers of these lands, surveying them with cruel detachment through four compound eyes. Their claws and hooves, at all times covered in gore, are strong enough to tear through armour, bone and muscle with ease. In addition to their physical prowess Mawfiends are also gifted in the dark arts, particularly magic of fire and blood. Bound to Slaughtermasters with complex bloodpacts, Mawfiends are nonetheless agents of Chaos and true Daemons. Despite their calculating minds, Mawfiends are still connected in some way to the Great Maw and if injured may be unable to contain their rage and hunger."

#name "Prophet of the Great Maw"
#descr "Skrag the Slaughterer was formerly a promising Butcher who made the mistake of cooking his Tyrant's favourite pet gnoblar. For this mistake he was hurled into the Gorger caverns with his hands severed and meatpot chained to his flesh. Incredibly, Skrag emerged two years later at the head of a pack of Gorgers, devoured the Tyrant and slaughtered the entire tribe as an offering to the Maw. Now the Prophet of the Maw, Skrag is an embodiment of hunger and destruction; the meat-pot he drags behind him has become a mobile mawpit into which he tosses severed chunks of butchered foes. Skrag is unable to restrain himself in battle, dismembering enemy after enemy, constantly feeding the meatpot and growing ever more gorged on the Maw's favour. Ever since leaving the caverns, Skrag's mere presence in battle has attracted Gorgers who charge forward to attack their terrified prey and can even appear from the flanks, bursting from cover or simply erupting from the ground. As a Prophet of the Great Maw, Skrag spreads the ravenous dominion of his god and calls the blessings of the maw on the entire army by his mere presence.

Ogre Slavers aren't uncommon in the Old World, but only one can claim to enslave the dead as well as the living. Some years ago Braugh was imprisoned by a necromancer, but being an Ogre of impressive size and strength he managed to rip the enchanted chains that bound him from the walls. He then proceeded to beat the necromancer to death with them and drag the other prisoners away with him as slaves. Somehow the power of the necromancer was trapped in the chains and when one of the slaves died from exhaustion Braugh was amused to find the corpse still bound by dark magic. Years of close contact with the dark chains has altered Braugh into something not quite living and armed with his terrible Fleshflayer he is a terrifying sight.

Even veteran Maneaters shudder at the thought of finding themselves across the field of battle from him, for the Gutsman is known for inflicting the most gruesome kind of death the simple mind of an Ogre can imagine. Bragg was once a rank and file Bull notable for little more than a particular knack for lopping off heads and limbs with his choppa, spending much of his youth fighting with Black Orcs in the lands around Fire Mouth. But all that changed when he broke his blade and found a replacement in the great axe of a fallen Black Orc Big Boss, reforging the enchanted metal in the magma of Fire Mouth itself and in a moment of inspiration, fashioning the Great Gutgouger, a hook bladed flail of vicious design. Bragg and the Gutgouger were a perfect match and he soon grew famous for personally slaying Orc Bosses, Skaven Warlords, even Champions of Chaos; but it was the effect of this weapon in inter-tribal warfare that truly made Bragg infamous. He discovered that the bladed hook could strike around a gutplate and slice open the vulnerable Ogre gut, sending his entrails spilling onto the ground and so soon became known as the Gutsman, a high-executioner of Ogre kind. Though Bragg has proven himself in battle many times and is greatly feared, no Ogre will follow him, for none wish to imagine themselves falling prey to the Gutgouger."

-------- NATION

#selectnation 121
#name "Goldtooth Tribe"
#epithet "Gathering of Might"
#era 2
#brief "The Ogre Kingdoms are a loose coalition of Ogre tribes which, if they set their rather simple minds to it, might devour the entire world."
#descr "Long ago the Ogres dwelled far to the East of the Old World, seldom roaming beyond their lands bordering Great Cathay. The impact of the Great Maw, a massive entity fallen from the heavens, wiped out half of their kind and forced the rest into a great migration East. Instilled with the endless hunger of the Great Maw, the Ogres swarmed the mountain homes of the Sky Giants and overcame them with sheer weight of numbers. Quickly adapting to the environment, the Ogres made the mountains their home, dominated the cowardly Gnoblars and spread out, splintering into dozens of smaller Tyrant ruled Kingdoms. For a time the Ogres warred amongst themselves, only leaving their homes to raid or seek employment as mercenaries. In recent years the hunger of the Maw has once again grown overpowering and the tribes, grown to unheard of size, are slowly uniting under the banner of Overtyrant Greasus Goldtooth."
#summary "Race: Hungry Ogres, Ogre-kin, Gnoblars. Prefer Cold Scale 2.
Military: Powerful Ogre infantry, numerous Gnoblars and specialised creatures.
Magic: Blood, Fire, minor Earth and Nature.
Priests: Average, cannot preach, but get a bonus when blood sacrificing. Hungry Maw dominion requires constant sacrifice."

The Censer Bearers are fed a special brew laced with warpstone which further enhances their zeal and physical prowess. In battle Censer bearers charge ahead of the ranks of Plague Monks, reciting the Liturgicus Infecticus at a frenzied pitch. They then charge the enemy and begin swinging their heavy censers, releasing a cloud of poisonous gas which is almost as fatal to the Skaven as it is to their foes. This proves to be little deterrent to these fanatic ratmen who scream prayers of thanks to God even as they die, their lungs filled with blood and pus. With the awakening of God, the Censers have become sacred to all Skaven."

A seething mass of stinking fur and sharp fangs, these creatures can overwhelm even the most disciplined enemies. While they are entirely undisciplined creatures merely following their instincts, they are able to flow across a battlefield like water, packing a great number of their kind into any gap to tear at their foes.

The ones that survive to maturity are little more than a mass of sinewy muscles and razor-sharp claws, moved only by their overpowering instinct to kill. As a result of their verminous origins, Rat Ogres have essentially animal minds and can be cowed by enemies with power over beasts. They are best goaded into battle under the experienced lashes and barbs of Moulder handlers. A limited number can be purchased directly for making war, but Clan Moulder's Mutators must be utilised to provide larger numbers of these beasts.

As the Doomwheel tears forward towards the enemy it unleashes energy in the form of arcing warplightning which can tear through the ranks of the enemy. The closer the Doomwheel gets, the more numerous the crackling blasts of warplightning become, though the Warlock can only afford to unleash the energy a handful of times. In addition to this fearsome ranged attack, the Doomwheel is quite capable of simply running over enemy formations, crushing even heavily armoured troops beneath the great wheels. The churning of the wheels offers the Warlock quite some protection and in addition he is protected by a crackling, sparking field of warp energy that deters all but the bravest of attackers from getting close enough to strike."

#descr "The Plague Chantors of Clan Pestilens have recently gained importance as servants of the Awakening God and are now found in many incursions to the surface. They chant sermons of corruption and suffering as they lead the Plague Monks into battle, ringing leper bells and calling for the Horned Rat to bless His numerous, pestilent children. Chantors have been through near constant exposure to warpstone incense and have become highly resistant to poison, making them suitable leaders for the dangerous Plague Censers. Many Chantors pursue the traditional Skaven magic of death and decay, but their order has also adopted an ancient and terrible form of blood magic found in the darkest depths of the Lustrian jungle. Exposure to both warpstone and virulent diseases has altered the physical form of the Chantors, leaving them considerably tougher than most Skaven."

The Screaming Bell spreads the dominion of the Horned Rat in much the same fashion as a prophet. Furthermore, the warpstone brazier on the Screaming Bell empowers the Grey Seer making him an even more potent and rapid spellcaster and granting him more accurate visions of the future.

#name "Chosen Grey Seer"
#descr "Thanquol is a skaven of incredible cunning, ruthlessness and caution even by the standards of his kind. His meteoric rise through the ranks of the Grey Seers marked him as a Chosen of the Horned Rat and this, coupled with his arcane prowess, has made him a favourite agent of the Council of Thirteen. Though he has as many enemies as allies, Thanquol's paranoia, survival instincts and powers of farsight have enabled him to survive every attempt on his life, usually at great cost to those unlucky enough to find themselves nearby. Indeed it is said that so blessed is Thanquol that those who attempt to harm him often inexplicably harm themselves instead. Thanquol carries the Staff and Amulet of the Horned One at all times, granting him increased magical prowess and rapid healing."

#descr "Ikit Claw has taken Clan Skryre's mix of science and sorcery to new levels of complexity and depravity. Entire legions of Skavenslaves have been blasted to bits in the name of Ikit's experimental weapons, though this is a small price to pay for his additions to Clan Skryre's deadly arsenal. In his unending quest for knowledge Ikit has travelled the world stealing secrets from the mystics of Cathay, studying the dimension spanning machinery of Lustria, and toiling for years alongside the forgemasters of far Zharr-Naggrund. The only wind of magic that resisted Ikit's learning was that which held the least interest to him; the wind of Ghyran, the lore of life. A prodigy with an almost instant ability to learn and understand new arcana, Ikit is constantly frustrated by the limited minds and petty ambitions of those in power and during a recent civil war rose to the position of Chief Warlock of Skryre and right claw to Lord of Decay Morskittar specifically to try and set his Clan upon a path to limitless achievement once more. Ikit was born a large skaven with white fur, marking him out for greatness, but a failed experiment exploded and mangled his body, leaving him crippled and disfigured. Ikit took to solving the problem of his physical ruin with characteristic verve, building a warpstone powered mechanical frame and replacement arm that grant him great strength and resilience. He also installed a miniaturised warpfire thrower and forged a deadly warp halberd known as Storm Daemon, that constantly draws magical energy into a warpstone battery integrated into his frame. While Ikit is a skilled forger of magical items, his status allows him to spare no expense and he does not forge cheaply in the manner of lesser Engineers."

#descr "Unequalled in experience, power or cruelty, Throt the Unclean embodies the spirit of Clan Moulder. Obsessed with the effects of warpstone mutation, he has performed countless experiments on living creatures, even himself. His scarred form is nearly as large as that of a Rat Ogre, his blood courses with warpstone energy and he wields the infamous Dominator Whip, a Creature Killer and a sword with three powerful arms. Throt's extremely accelerated metabolism has granted him the ability to regenerate and overcome almost any wound, but it has also left him ravenously hungry at all times. Having spawned literally hundreds of offspring, Throt is something of a patriarchal figure in Clan Moulder, though in typical Skaven fashion, he has personally killed many of his own brood who threatened his position. In addition to his sheer power in combat, Throt is a feared general who handpicks the strongest Rat Ogres as his personal guard.

None are better attuned to their foul creations than Skweel Gnawtooth, the most successful Packmaster in Hell Pit. Skweel was a runt who survived by relying not on other Skaven, but on Giant Rats. In time this undersized anomaly became a celebrated Packmaster, always accompanied by a teeming horde of his beasts. In battle these creatures need not be driven into battle with pain, rather they act seemingly as extensions of the Packmaster's will. Whether this is the result of a mutation, some new form of magic or simply willpower and experience is unclear, but none can deny the results.

#name "Grand Chieftain"
#descr "Over many battles and countless acts of treachery, Grand Chieftain Tretch Craventail of Clan Rictus has proven himself a master of guile. Even for a Skaven, who expect duplicitous tactics, it is widely admitted that Tretch has a knack for fighting dirty. Indeed, Tretchs repertoire of underhanded skills and his famously good luck has led to a number of legendary deeds, including the flanking movement that won Clan Rcitus the battle of Black Crag, the enslaving of every goblin under the banner of Warlord Baglad and the assassination of the previous Grand Chieftain of the Deep Warrens. Tretch prefers to let others do the fighting for him and is an expert at setting other Skaven at the throats of his foes, but his greatest asset is his impossibly good luck, granted in part by the runed rat ogre skull atop his helm. Many times the duplicitous Grand Chieftain's good fortune has seemed to come to and end and his life finally ended, only for Tretch to emerge once more, revealing that he faked his death, somehow escaped, or an unlucky subordinate was slain in his place. Tretch will take any advantage in battle and has thus learned to use his tail to wield an extra weapon."

Any Skaven with ambitions to become a member of the Council must first stand before the judgement of the pillar. Most will perish immediately, but those who survive may then challenge a member of the Council to a fight to the death, with his seat going to the victor. With the coming of this new age of opportunity for the Skaven the Commandments have begun to shift and give new direction to the Skaven."

The current Seerlord has retained his position for hundreds, perhaps thousands of years and is notoriously cautious and wiley, even for a Lord of Decay. Like lesser Grey Seers the Seerlord can often see beyond past and present to predict and avert disasters which are near enough to potentially cause him harm. Additionally, the blessing of the Horned Rat will sometimes turn attacks made against him back upon their enemies."

The Arch Plaguelord rides into battle atop a fetid pox rat, a Pestilens creation which releases a constant cloud of poisonous vapour. As a living vessel of pure contagion, the Arch Plaguelord is both terrifying to behold and incredibly resilient.

#msg "Welcome! The Skaven mod has a special mechanic which makes them a little different from other nations:

Warpstone Seams. Every turn in any province controlled by the Skaven there is a small chance that a Warpstone Seam will be discovered; a site which provides 1 fire, 1 earth, and 1 death gem but also increases unrest. There can only ever be one Warpstone Seam in a province and each turn there is a chance that it will become an Exhausted Warpstone Seam, a chance greatly increased if the Skaven no longer control the province. Exhausted Warpstone Seams do not provide any gems or create any unrest, but prevent a Warpstone Seam being found in the province.

Exhausted Warpstone Seams controlled by the Skaven have a chance each turn to become functioning Warpstone Seams again if there is a lab present, although there is also a chance the lab may be destroyed in the process, or even destroyed without restoring the site."

#epithet "Rise of the Under-Empire"
#era 2
#brief "The Skaven are a race of evil warpstone corrupted ratmen who have tunneled under much of the Old World and beyond. They are naturally cunning and vicious, incredibly numerous and capable of surviving in adverse conditions, however they are also cowardly and prone to infighting. Skaven society follows a strict heirarchy; the Council of Thirteen and Grey Seers at the top, Greater and Warlord Clans in the middle and the countless slaves at the bottom."
#descr "The Skaven are a race of malevolent rat-men that inhabit the underground of the Warhammer world. The tunnels of their vast under-empire reach from the steaming jungles of the South Lands to the snow-covered steppes of Kislev, from the Western borders of Estalia and Bretonnia to the lost realms of the Far East. Their capital is the myseterious city of Skavenblight, hidden in the centre of the foul marches lying on the western borders of Tilea. There the mighty Lords of Decay, ruthless rulers of all Skaven, sit in the Council of Thirteen, scheming and planning in preparation for the time when their armies will emerge from their subterranean realm to raze the entire surface world and rule over its ruins. This is the ultimate ambition of the Skaven race, a destiny which is preached by the Grey Seers, who are powerful wizards and prophets of the Horned Rat - the malevolent Skaven deity. Skaven society follows a strict heirarchy; the Council of Thirteen and Grey Seers at the top, the Greater and Warlord Clans in the middle and the countless masses of slaves at the bottom. The fortunes of any individual are a different matter though; no race is so prone to scheming, intrigue and outright betrayal as the Skaven, with each ratlike mind devoted almost entirely to climbing the slippery ladder of power."
#summary "Race: Ratmen. Stealthy, minor poison and disease resistance, mountain survival, good at sieging
Military: Massed infantry, experimental fire, shock, and poison weapons, and mutated beasts
Magic: Death, Earth, Fire, Blood, some Astral
Priests: Powerful, can perform blood sacrifices
Mechanics: Can discover warpstone sites, exhaust them, and reopen them with labs. Heroes not tied to luck scale"

#descr "The pike is ubiquitous in the lands of Tilea, Estalia, and to a lesser the Border Princes, perhaps even as common as the crossbow. Regiments of pikemen frequently form the core battle line of mercenary forces and have proven their effectiveness countless times against all manner of foes, though they are especially useful against an enemy with poor morale or a lack of good armour. Though these regions lack the mass manufacturing of plate armour available to the State Troops of the Empire, they have a good supply of chain mail, much of it passed down through many generations of fractious internal warfare. Such is the ubiquity of pike regiments in Tilea that standard training practices for these troops have become quite advanced and virtually all pikemen are drilled in tight formation fighting and marching long distances."

As such it is a common sight to see on the battlefield and most mercenary forces can boast many experienced Crossbowmen. They typically work in concert with the battle line of Pikemen, whittling down enemy missile troops and providing a threat against heavily armoured foes. The Crossbowmen of Tilea tend to be quite well drilled and accurate with their chosen weapons but are otherwise lightly equipped and unsuited to melee combat."

#descr "Estalia is a realm of men to the west of Tilea and is not dissimilar in its fractious nature, extensive use of mercenaries, and the dominance of great rival cities. Almogavars are particularly ferocious infantry that are a common sight on Estalian battlefields; they are men from the hills, barely civilised by the standards of more urbane Estalians, who have made raiding and warfare a way of life. When Estalia was invaded and brought under the control of Araby it was the villages and hamlets controlled by the Almogavars that offered the firmest resistance and these hardy warriors became greatly feared and respected by the foreigners. Now Almogavars can often be found working as mercenaries as far afield as Araby, the Border Princes, and of course Tilea. They are not heavily armoured and fight with relatively simple weapons of a previous era; spears and javelins, but they are physically strong, skilled, brave, and surprisingly well disciplined."

Estalia in particular venerates the art of the fencer and provides a ready supply of trained swordsmen seeking mercenary work. As with pikemen, mercenary swordsmen make use of chain mail rather than the plate mass manufactured for State Troops in the Empire, but they carry shields to afford them with extra protection and tend to wear helms of Estalian design. They are typically better skilled in one on one combat than pikemen but lack the formation drilling and marching exercises employed by their fellows."

#descr "Dwarfs have a reputation for sticking with their own kind and many never travel far beyond the hold their clan calls home, for they are a race beset by many enemies and often facing a shortage of ablebodied warriors to defend or reclaim what remains of their once glorious civilisation. Nonetheless there are still many Dwarfs who live in communities beyond the holds, or seek life beyond the confines of their clan. Some of these Dwarfs, especially those in southern realms of men, take up the profession of mercenary and find no shortage of work, for while they can be hard negotiators, Dwarfs are also highly reliable. Mercenary Dwarf Warriors fight in the traditional style of their people with axe and shield and always carry the finest quality arms and armour. They make excellent heavy infantry for holding a line or hacking their way through lesser foes."

These tribes war with each other and the raid the trade caravans of the cities constantly, so it is little surprise that many of their warriors are attracted by mercenary life and find employ in the armies of Tilea, Estalia, or even the Border Princes. Arabyan tribal infantry are daring fighters well practiced with their chosen weapons; compact and powerful bows, flashing curved blades, and small shields with a central spike used both to parry and stab. They wear little in the way of armour, but their dark coloured robes are of excellent quality and are said to incorporate Cathayan silk stolen from unfortunate Arabyan traders."

From Magritta the Cult of Myrmidia ventures forth into the world to influence the course of wars, seek influence with military commanders and rulers of cities alike, and to combat evil wherever it is found. Myrmidians are the shock troops of the Cult, an exclusively female order of infantry who fight in the style of the ancient warriors of the southern realms and whose arms and armour are blessed by Myrmidia's hand. Myrmidians carry with them the four favours of their Goddess; the spear that pierces the malign, the shield that protects the weak, the symbol of the eagle that watches from above, and the dazzling aura of the sun. While they are based in Magritta, the Cult of Myrmidia has established temples in other realms and the Myrmidians are considered sacred even in Tilea."

The Border Princes are known to be even more fractious and politically tumultuous than Tilea, for even the pretty kingdoms that make up the land are constantly changing as different charismatic, powerful, or rich individuals seek to establish their own nation. The warfare of pike and crossbow is less popular here than in Estalia or Tilea and warfare is largely dominated by a slog of massed infantry combat punctuated by decisive heavy cavalry charges. Proximity to the Empire has led the Freelancers to adopt very heavy plate armour and barding similar to those used to the north, though they lack the dwarf smithing that makes Imperial Full Plate so prized. While Freelancers are genuinely excellent heavy cavalry they are notoriously costly as mercenaries and aren't particularly willing to put their necks on the line should the tide of battle turn."

#name "Estalian Almocaden"
#descr "Estalia is a realm of men to the west of Tilea and is not dissimilar in its fractious nature, extensive use of mercenaries, and the dominance of great rival cities. Almogavars are particularly ferocious infantry that are a common sight on Estalian battlefields; they are men from the hills, barely civilised by the standards of more urbane Estalians, who have made raiding and warfare a way of life. When Estalia was invaded and brought under the control of Araby it was the villages and hamlets controlled by the Almogavars that offered the firmest resistance and these hardy warriors became greatly feared and respected by the foreigners. Now Almogavars can often be found working as mercenaries as far afield as Araby, the Border Princes, and of course Tilea. Almocadens are the leaders of Almogavar groups, always promoted up from the ranks based on experience and merit. They are canny tacticians who specialise in leading small groups on raids and can be recognised by their use of the sword and scaled armour, both rare items in Almogavar society."

They are well equipped and dress in a rather flamboyant fashion, eager to show their hard earned wealth."

#name "Assassin"
#descr "The realms of Tilea, Estalia, and the Border Princes are fractious, ruled over by petty tyrants and merchant princes with little sense of unity with or loyalty to their neighbours; wealth and power are always the great motivators. As such the trade of assassins flourishes in these lands and it is not unheard of for a succession of powerful individuals to be mysteriously slain in a short period of time, before some fortunate figure emerges to reap the benefits of their demise and carve up their former holdings. This assassin is a skilled combatant and makes use of a crossbow, the traditional weapon of Tilea. Assassins are careful to ensure they keep on the good side of smugglers and pirates and will not take up work against the residents of the famed pirate isle of Sartosa; as such they can make use of ships to sail considerable distances."

#name "Estalian Alchemist"
#descr "Estalia is a region not dissimilar to Tilea or the Border Princes in its fractious nature, as various small kingdoms and city states vie for power and trading dominance. It was once almost entirely conquered by the forces of Araby but was subsequently liberated by a grand alliance of Bretonnia, Marienburg, the Empire, and Tilea. A subsequently uneasy peace eventually gave way to enthusiastic trading and the fortunes of Estalia improved as the cities, Magritta in particular, became centres of commerce with an increasingly polyglot population. The Alchemists Guild was born from this melting pot of influences and to this day trains some of the finest Alchemists in the world, rivalling the Gold College of the Empire but providing a far less rigid education. Estalian Alchemists are commonly employed across the southern regions where they are free to practice their arts without the superstitous persecution they might face further north, though they tend to ask quite an exorbitant fee. In addition to their skill at converting magical resources to gold, Alchemists can create and use short lived but effective magical gems of earth and fire to use in combat. They are known for their uses of stange acidic liquids, necessary components of their art, which they can hurl in battle."

#descr "Tilea shares many similarities with the lands of the the Empire and of Bretonnia, and its attitude toward users of magic shares aspects of both cultures, as well as influences from Estalia. In Bretonnia magic is strictly the domain of the servants of The Lady and closely tied to the national religion, while in the Empire it is the Colleges of Magic originally established by the High Elf Teclis that restrict and control such power. While Tilea makes use of Alchemists from Estalia and mercenary College Mages from the Empire, the heart of their magical prowess comes from the Society of Sorceresses, a cabal of female magic users of considerable power and influence. Sorceresses do focus their studies like their counterparts in the Empire and will never attempt to master more than one or maybe two Winds of Magic, but universally study astrology, prognostication, and herbology too, for these disciplines are vital in their position as advisors and protectors of the rulers of the cities of Tilea. It is said that the Sorceresses of Tilea were originally taught their art by Elves who did not wish to return to their homeland of Ulthuan and settled in the south of the Old World. Sorceresses are known for their beauty and it said they have discovered some method to retain their youth."

#descr "The members of Ragged Ricco's Republican Guard are amongst the wealthiest and best equipped mercenaries in all of Tilea. Though initially the regiment was formed exclusively of former soldiers serving the new Republic of Remas, as it grew in fame and popularity as a mercenary company it attracted a great number of aspiring applicants, from which Ricco hand picks only those with a sense of justice to match their thirst for wealth and adventure. The Republican Guard is well drilled and comprised of skilled and physically fit soldiers, but their most remarkable feature is their ornate and expensive armour; simultaneously a way of displaying the success of the regiment, keeping a soldier's accumulated wealth close to hand, and offering them superb protection. The Guard fight in tight pike formations and adorn their equipment with blood red scarves to show pride in their battle scars and white scarves to show the favour of the local populace. Under Ricco's leadership they have made a habit of taking on just causes where possible and are equally well practiced at rooting out bandits and protecting besieged holds."

During the struggle which would eventually birth the new Republic of Remas the fighting was intense, raging through ever street in the city, and Ricco was wounded a score of times but still survived to rally and assume command of the Guard, eventually defeating the mercenaries hired by the Prince. Ricco was hailed as the savior of the Republic and showered with praise, but the city of Remas was left virtually bankrupt and the Guard agreed to become a mercenary regiment and support themselves rather than demanding pay from their beleaguered home. Under Ricco's leadership and with considerable experience in battle the Republican Guard quickly found great success and wealth in the mercenary life and established themselves as a professional and reliable force with a strong sense of justice (for mercenaries at least). Hearing of their exploits the Republic of Remas bid them return, and promptly imprisoned Ricco, demanding the Guard hand over their earnings to the merchant council for 'the good of the city'. The Guard fought their way into and out of the leaning tower of Remas, freeing their leader and vowing to return some day to liberate their home once more. Like his men Ricco wears ornate and expensive armour and is a highly skilled fighter. Such is Ricco's charm and popularity with the common folk that his mere presence decreases unrest.

Although their armour is hopelessly out of date and cheap, it does afford them decent enough protection that they are able to hold the line and they make up for their lower quality with low cost in gold, large size of the regiment, and belief in their cause.

Rodrigo lost almost everything; his farm, his fortune, his house, and even several cousins, to the rampaging mercenaries. He realised that for all his suffering, it was truly the farmers and peasants who got the worst of the constant battles in Tilea, so he pledged to do something about it. Rodrigo took what small wealth he had left, bought a supply of antiquated but still functional armour and second hand pikes from a trader, rallied a group of former labourers left homeless by the war, and founded the Alcatani Fellowship. The Fellowship recruits exclusively from the peasantry and is never short of recruits, for Rodrigo is famously fair to his men and known to take up the cause of the commonfolk for very low rates indeed. While Rodrigo is not a particularly skilled military commander, his enthusiasm for the cause is infectious and he is known for his excellent pre-battle speeches. Wherever Rodrigo travels the peasants sing of his greatness, and what the Fellowship lack in quality gear or hardened soldiers, they make up in numbers and their low cost.

#descr "The Bearmen of Urslo are an infamous mercenary regiment of Norse Marauders, hailing from the Urslo tribe of distant Ursfjord. The Urslo tribe has long worshipped the bear for its ferocity and strength and long ago the capricious Chaos Gods delivered a boon to the mightiest warriors of the tribe, turning them into the Bear-stricken, men able to twist their nature and form to that of the bear. Though all members of the tribe grew stronger from this blessing, only the most powerful champions of Urslo are fully Bearstruck and transform into werebears. Beorg is the latest Chieftain of Urslo and the most potently blessed in generations, for he is permanently transformed into a towering amalgam of man and bear. When a great Chaos incursion swept south he and his men joined to raid and bring glory to Urslo, but the incursion scattered over time and Beorg's group found themselves hunted in hostile lands. Hearing of an opportunity for coin and battle they headed south and became a mercenary regiment, finding it easy to stand out amongst the weak men of the civilised lands. Beorg is a terrible force on the battlefield, rending the enemy to pieces with his claws and fangs while protected by both chain mail armour and the ward provided by the magical Bear Fang Talisman passed to him by the elders of Urslo.

As an arrogant young martial artist trained in the use of the quarterstaff Wu Song once took a challenge to drink a huge amount of alcohol and then walk a path rumoured to be prowled by tigers. As he came face to face with one of the beasts he suddenly realised he was too drunk to flee and would have to fight, but in his haste to throw the tiger off balance he accidentally broke his staff on a tree and the tiger pounced on him. Filled with a drunken rage he managed to pin the creature and struck in its skull with his bare hands, much to his own amazement. Wu Song went on to develop a martial art focused on unarmed strikes and the tempering of the body using internal energies unlocked by the drinking of potent alcohol. Travelling west he so impressed a group of bandits that they swore to follow him to the ends of the earth and enthusiastically took up his practice of drinking before combat, though they lack the patience to truly learn his art.

Most of these newly raised undead cannot sustain their unholy vigour past the end of the battle and crumble away to dust, but some join the regiment. They are mindless puppets that serve as Richter's mercenary regiment purely to continue his curse to seek constant battle and death as the leader of a mercenary force. Each carries a shield bearing the marking of the Cursed Company. Unlike other skeletal warriors the Cursed Companions are still acting out the pantomime of being mercenaries and as such require payment in gold, though it is not known what they or Richter do with it. The power of the curse is such that these undead are tougher and harder to banish than usual."

Tasked with a special mission to deliver a selection of incredibly rare ale for a royal wedding in a distant hold, the ship was caught in a sudden and massive storm near the isle of Sartosa. Both ship and cargo were lost, but miraculously Drong and nearly a third of is crew survived, washed up on the beach of the isle. The shame of this loss was too great to bear and they all swore the Slayer Oath on the spot, before heading inland and quickly taking over both the stronghold and ship of the pirate Capitano Sisicco. From their base in Sartosa the Slayer Pirates struck out to fulfil their vows (and fill their pockets) and made a reputation for themselves recovering treasure chests lost to monsters or other fearsome enemies. As the reputation of Long Drong's Slayer Pirates grew they were joined by other shamed seafaring Dwarfs and they are now one of the most famous mercenary regiments. Drong is a fearsome slayer instantly recognisable for his hook hand, peg leg, and the tropical bird always perched on his shoulder.

#descr "Voland was once a knight of the Empire, though his actual origins are the subject of much dispute. He rose to prominence as the leader of a band of mercenary knights known as the Venators; a low Tilen word meaning 'hunters'. Voland's Venators provided well trained and armed heavy cavalry at a time when Tilea was particularly riven by internal conflict and each city-state had become desperate to defend itself not only from its rivals but from marauding bands of former employees and commonfolk turned to banditry. In this environment the Venators flourished and quickly gained a reputation for excellence, though at a steep cost. The members of the Venators are all drawn from nobility in the lands of Bretonnia, Estalia, the Empire, even Kislev, each of whom has found some reason to abandon his former life and take a new name as a member of Voland's regiment. The Venators proudly wear no heraldry other than a simple V painted on their shields. Voland himself is a capable commander and warrior, though his interests often lie in gold, feasting, and women rather than glory in battle.

These Pavise Crossbowmen wear heavy armour gilded in the traditional Miragliano style and are experts in siege warfare. They aren't quite the shots with their crossbows that the famous Marksmen of Miragliano are, but their superior protection means they are very effective when exchanging vollies of fire with enemy archers.

Braganza was their Captain from the birth of the regiment and being well regarded by Borgio for his work under his banner was happily given full control of the force, so long as he sent a cut of the profits to Borgio as their patron and sponsor.

#name "Birdman of Catrazza"
#descr "The Birdmen of Catrazza are a bizarre mercenary regiment propelled to great heights both literal and figurative by an invention of the great genius Leonardo da Miragliano adapted by the lesser genius Daddallo of Verezzo. Equipped with a mechanical winged harness they are able to take to the skies for limited periods and this has proven a highly marketable talent in such a fortified and fractious land as Tilea. The Birdmen initially experimented with melee weapons, diving down with sword or lance, but being lightly armoured, necessarily slight of build, and encumbered by the harness, they soon abandoned this tactic in favour of the classic Tilean crossbow. They are usually employed as a rapid response force or hired to help besiege a particularly troublesome fortification. They are known for their bravery and their pride in their unusual talents and monicker as 'Birdmen', which they flaunt by wearing ornate beaked masks. In their line of work the Birdmen often find themselves the targets of ranged weapons and since shields and heavy armour are too heavy, they've come up with various ingenious tricks using their wings and powerful buffets of air to protect themselves from incoming fire."

His patron wished him to build a complex water mill sketched out in the notes, but Daddallo quickly became obsessed with a designs for a winged harness that would allow a man to fly. Though it ruined his career, put him heavily in debt, and earned him a reputation as a madman, Daddallo perfected the harness and fled from the moneylenders, forming a mercenary band equipped with copies of his own harness. The regiment quickly gained their fame when they rescued the daughter of a merchant prince from the supposedly impregnable Tower of Catrazza and has since gone from strength to strength. Daddallo isn't a particularly capable leader or soldier, though his enthusiasm is infectious and no-one else knows how to construct the harnesses. He is armed with another invention adapted from Leonardo's notebook, a rapid firing crossbow, though he has yet to perfect the design and it is quite inaccurate.

#descr "Members of Pirazzo's Lost Legion are drilled in an unusual system of fighting which emphasises quickly switching the entire formation from the use of crossbows at long range to pikes as the enemy closes in. No man may join the Legion until he has demonstrated skill with both weapons and even then Pirazzo will insist on considerable training with his comrades before his allowed to join the formation proper in combat. Legionnaires wear heavy armour designed in the famed steelforges of the Estalian city of Tobaro and make an excellent hybrid regiment for those who can afford their services. Such is Pirazzo's obsession with preparation and good discipline that the Lost Legion is capable of marching great distances despite their armour."

#descr "Fernando Pirazzo was one of three mercenary captains tasked with the protection of a doomed expedition from the merchant city of Tobaro in Estalia to the continent of Lustria. Though he was the youngest of the three and not particularly notable as a fighter himself, Pirazzo already had a reputation for his near obsession with military training and preparation, though his advice was often overruled by the other captains. When the expedition landed and immediately ran into a series of problems Pirazzo had repeatedly warned them of in advance, including the ships they came on abandoning them with the paychests, it didn't take long for the mercenaries to realise Pirazzo was their best hope and quickly dispatch of their former leaders. The young captain whipped the force into shape, separating them into well coordinated crossbow and pike formations, and driving the bad elements out of the camp to perish in the jungle. Setting off into the interior of the continent Pirazzo's men at first battled with the native lizard people and performed well, showing the Skinks and Saurus the power of their disciplined formations, but a strange accord was finally met between Pirazzo and a Skink Priest and the Estalians were granted unusual gold tablets in exchange for marching south to a new coastline. Here they battled vampires and a throng of zombie pirates, realising that the Skink Priest had effectively hired them as mercenaries. Stealing a half rotted pirate ship the remaining forces managed to make it back to Tobaro and Pirazzo used his Lustrian gold to form an entirely novel mercenary regiment trained to use both pike and crossbow, switching between them at a moment's notice. His fame spread as a man who returned from doom and Pirazzo's 'Lost Legion' as they were known became highly sought after.

These cloaks are enchanted by the forbidden magic used by Malkus to grant them considerable protection against mundane weapons and render the Manflayers harder to detect. Both of these attributes lend themselves well to the primary task of the regiment; to raid, plunder, and sow terror in enemy lands. Each Corsair is armed with a pair of wicked serrated blades and wears light armour which still allows them to swim should they need to. Like all Dark Elf Corsairs they are skilled fighters and there are few in the Old World that can match them."

Small and plump, with a fondness for food and drink, they are not natural fighters but are excellent woodsmen and are extremely resistant to hostile magic. The Halfling Rangers that make up the regiment known as the Fighting Cocks take the Halfling affinity for nature, hunting, and stealth to quite an extreme and additionally have an unusual fondness for warfare, particularly when they can ambush the enemy or simply pepper them from long range while others take most of the risk. They are excellent marksmen though will struggle to damage well armoured enemies. The Cocks take their name from the bright red plumes they wear atop their hats and their crowing victory calls as their enemies flee."

So it was that Croop became one of the most prolific poachers and thieves in the Moot and accidentally became something of a folk hero to likeminded Halflings born in poverty. Eventually caught by a force of trackers dispatched by angry landowners, Croop improvised a tale of the wealth and adventure awaiting Halflings like him in the distant land of Tilea and was so convincing that the trackers, and many other young Halflings impressed by tales of Croop's exploits, joined him on a long journey south. For his part Croop constantly tried to sneak away to avoid the responsibilities of leadership, but his trackers were as skilled as he and he would always be caught, having to explain the entire thing was a 'test of initiative'. Eventually Croop's group reached Tilea and did indeed find both wealth and adventure as the regiment known as Lumpin Croop's Fighting Cocks, for there is great demand for such skilled woodsmen and archers at affordable rates.

#descr "The Ogres that make up Golgfag's regiment are hardened mercenaries who recognise that they're probably better off being on the side of their hulking Captain than standing against him on the field of battle. Ogres are well known for taking up work as mercenaries, particularly those who have headed east or west from the Ogre Kingdoms of the Mountains of Mourn and run into the realms of Men, Greenskins, and Dwarfs. Should they become particularly successful they will usually choose to split off and either return to their homeland to seek power there or try their hand at even more lucrative opportunities, but Golgfag's reputation ensures that his Ogres tend to stay for longer than usual. Golgfag's mercenaries are inevitably well armed and armoured and are among the most effective shock troops available in Tilea."

#descr "The Arabyans that make up Al Muktar's Desert Dogs are all experienced riders who hail from one of the many nomadic tribes on the border of the Great Desert in Araby. They are talented fighters with with the unusual curved blades of their land and protect themselves with shields and cloth of surprising quality, but their greatest asset is their magnificent white steeds. The horses kept by the nomadic Desert tribes of Araby are perhaps the finest in the world and the breed used by the tribe from which the Desert Dogs recruits make for particularly splendid mounts. The Desert Dogs, as such, make fine and very fast light cavalry, perfect for flanking the foe."

#descr "The man now known as the fearless Al Muktar, commander of the Desert Dogs, was once a Marienburg merchant's son named Werner Glook. Werner was a slight and rather timid youth subject to much bullying from his family and peers, who escaped the casual cruelty of his life by dreaming of adventures in exotic lands. He dedicated himself to learning the language of distant Araby and, when his father finally drank himself into to the grave, swiftly left for their exotic land. Once there rumours of a golden haired foreigner able to speak near perfect Arabyan spread and people whispered that this might perhaps be Al Muktar, the Fated One, whose arrival had been predicted by astrologers earlier that year. When his trade caravan was attacked by nomad raiders and unwilling to let his dream die, Werner fought like a man possessed, badly injuring several raiders before being subdued. The nomads were aggravated by his actions and decided to stake the foreigner out in the desert sun to die slowly, but somehow Werner clung to life for several days and in his delirium began to cry out an unfamiliar phrase he had heard whispered by strangers in his presence; 'Al Muktar'. The nomads, fearful that this strange figure might indeed be the Fated One, freed the foreigner and took him into their number. Within a few years Al Muktar, for that is who the man had become, or perhaps always been, had become their leader and brought them to fight as a mercenary company in the lands of Estalia and Tilea. Al Muktar rides upon the same fine Arabyan steed as his men and is armed in the same manner, having become a highly skilled warrior known for his boundless tenacity and bravery. Even people of other faiths can recognise that Al Muktar clearly has some divinely ordained destiny and he is considered sacred.

Called to reinforce a great host in the process of being destroyed by a massive army from Cathay, Oglah saw which way the wind was blowing and immediately switched sides, favouring Cathayan silver over potential death. This was fairly typical behaviour for a hobgoblin, but the Great Khan demanded greater loyalty from his inner circle and Oglah soon found his tribe pursued and harried almost to extinction by the Great Khan's forces. Fleeing his homeland and crossing the Dark Lands, the battle tested Khan and his wolf riders quickly took to mercenary life in the Old World. Oglah still receives reinforcements from hobgoblins who escape the lands of the Chaos Dwarfs or flee the steppe and his regiment, the Wolfboyz, have gained fame as a highly effective, if untrustworthy, force of cavalry archers.

Oglah has little patience for weakness or the typical backstabbing and cowardice of the hobgoblins found in the Dark Lands and emphasises a more pack-like mentality for his warriors. Consequently the Wolfboyz have quite a bit more fight to them than one might expect, though at the end of the day they are still hobgoblins.

These duelists are talented combatants and extensively train in a style which allows them to handle multiple foes at once, but their individualistic nature and the improvisational quality of their fighting art means they are not well suited to formation fighting.

Here his natural talents and intelligence proved insufficient to counter his recklessness and insubordination, leading to a swift expulsion and blacklisting from a career in the formal military. Lacking the background to secure a place in the nobleborn cavalry of a knightly order, Morgan was adrift, unable to use his training or talents. Fate smiled on the young man, as while drowning his sorrows in a tavern he got into an argument with a group of mercenaries which culminated in the first of the inspiring speeches for which he would later be famed. Hearing the bold speech several of the younger mercenaries agreed to join Morgan to prove themselves better than their elders and an elderly wizard of the Bright College, seeing a fire in Morgan's eyes, gifted him a magical blade named Grudgebringer. So began an illustrious mercenary career which would take Morgan all across the Old World and see him gain the favour of figures such as the Emperor Karl Franz, the Reiksmarshall Kurt Helborg, and King Louen Leoncoeur of Bretonnia.

#descr "Hengus is, as far as it is known, the only Druid of Albion to have left that mist shrouded land of bogs, faeries, and giants. He came to the Old World with a pair of giants as his bodyguards as part of a deal with a rather confused trade expidition from the city of Remas. Initially Hengus acted as an emissary of his land, but after fruitlessly explaining time and time again that Albion had little interest in the wares of Remas if they were to be accompanied by forced acceptance of military outposts and Reman 'civilisation', he chose to give up and leave. Unfortunately this angered the merchants of Remas and they placed a harsh embargo on transporting the Druid and his giants home, and so Hengus has taken up mercenary work in order to make ends meet until he can find a way home. The Druid himself is a capable spellcaster, but his true power comes from his bodyguards; towering giants of Albion capable of hurling boulders great distances and smashing entire regiments with their clubs. Like all Druids of Albion, Hengus is a talented healer. Very occasionally another Giant of Albion will find his way to Hengus and join him, though no-one is sure exactly how they get there!

#descr "Lorenzo Lupo is the current ruler of the Tilean city-state of Luccini and a descendant of that city's ancient founders. He is a controversial figure, lauded by some as a great general who might restore the glory of Ancient Tilea, and by others as a delusional thug clothing himself in the aesthetics of a lost time. From his youth Lorenzo has always been obsessed with the glory and splendour of the bygone age of his ancestors, when Tilea stood as an emerging power that led in military, artistic, and scholarly matters and, in his view, traded with the Elves of Ulthuan as equals. The ruler of Luccini lives in a palazzo decorated in the antique style, rejects many modern trappings, and even arms himself in the style of his forefathers. It was Lorenzo who reinstituted the athletic persuits of his ancestors and in many sports such as wrestling, rowing, and hurling of the discus, Lorenzo is a current or former champion, for the man is a towering figure of muscle like a living statue. Lorenzo has led many campaigns to retrieve the lost artifacts of his ancestors and now holds the deadly Sword of Lucan, the dazzling Shield of Myrmidia, and the inspiring Ring of Luccina. While many find the man faintly ridiculous or outright delusional, there is no doubting his military success or his popularity amongst his own troops. Because Lucan carries the Shield of Myrmidia he is sacred to the followers of the Goddess and to Tileans generally, as a people who prefer to hedge their bets when it comes to divinity."

#descr "Gotrek Gurnisson is perhaps the most famous Dwarf Slayer alive, which is ironic because he is in many ways an abject failure as a Slayer. At all turns Gotrek has failed to find a glorious death in battle; no matter how far he travels and how deadly a foe he faces, he always prevails, usually because he is a nearly unmatched killing machine. Gotrek wields a staggeringly powerful starmetal axe known as the Runemaster's Axe, recovered early in his Slayer career from the ruins of the fallen hold of Karak Dum; truly one of the greatest artifacts of the Dwarf golden age. In the Slayer's hands it has put an end to trolls, giants, vampires, beasts, and even a Greater Daemon of Chaos. Already a terrifying and near unstoppable force of destruction before he met the human agitator and adventurer Felix Jaeger, since that foolish warrior-poet swore a drunken blood oath to witness and write of his glorious death, Gotrek only seems to be more favoured, or perhaps cursed, by fate to overcome any foe."

#name "Warrior Poet"
#descr "Felix Jaeger is best known as the constant, if initially unwilling, companion of the legendary Dwarf Slayer Gotrek Gurnisson. Felix was born to wealthy merchants who sought entry into the ranks of the aristocracy of the Empire and so sent their son to study at the University of Altdorf and become an officer in the Imperial army. Felix, always something of a rebel, decided to take up poetry, drinking, and duelling instead, and his academic life ended when he accidentally killed a fellow student in a drunken duel. Expelled and disowned, Felix found himself amongst the common people and joined their cause in protesting the oppressive Window Tax in Altdorf, getting swept up in riots and nearly killed by a charge from mounted Reiksguard. His life was saved that day by Gotrek and Felix drunkenly swore a blood oath that he would witness and write of the Slayer's glorious death. He accompanies Gotrek to this day, though in his epic battle with a Greater Daemon the Slayer did technically die (if only temporarily) and the oath was released, so the two are no longer forced to spend every moment together. Felix was already a decent duellist and constant years of travel, adventure, and peril with Gotrek have sharpened his skills considerably, especially with a runeblade he found along the way, though he is of course nowhere near a match for the Slayer in the business of sheer destruction. Some of Gotrek's fate to survive no matter the odds has certainly rubbed off on Felix and he effectively bears the mark of Drengi like his companion."

#descr "By posting this Contract you will draw the services of a random Regiment of Renown. The commander and a starting force of his men will join your nation at this fort. Each Regiment of Renown is a unique force with its own strengths and weaknesses and there is no way to control which Regiment will answer the Contract, though the same Regiment cannot answer more than once. Should all of the available Regiments already have answered one of your Contracts previously, a non-unique Mercenary Captain and some troops will take it instead. Each commander of a Regiment will draw a certain number of reinforcements per month automatically, though their upkeep takes this into consideration.

#descr "By posting this Contract you will draw the services of a random hireling mage from the Empire's Colleges of Magic. The Colleges are sworn to serve the Empire but have a great deal of autonomy and many of their members choose to pursue work for hire in the other realms of men such as Tilea, Estalia, the Border Princes or even further abroad. Each of the eight Winds of Magic is represented by its own College and the mages of those Colleges are known by the common name for their respective wind, such as the Bright Wizards who use the fiery wind of Aqshy. This contract will supply you with a random mage from one of the eight Colleges: Amber, Amethyst, Bright, Celestial, Gold, Grey, Jade, and Light. Hiring mages in this way is rather expensive, but allows Tilea access to considerable magical diversity.

Amethyst Wizards are a potent force on the battlefield, capable of snuffing out life, undoing their foes and even animating the dead if the cause is severe enough to risk the wrath of the Sigmarites.

Because of this, Light Wizards tend to work together in complex rituals and communions to stand the best chance of casting their spells. Light magic can heal and protect, but also sear and consume, particularly against unnatural enemies. The pyramidal Light College lies at a mystic conjunction of power lines and taps into the energies of Hysh with an elaborate system of mirrors and prisms.

#name "Tilea"
#epithet "Dogs of War"
#era 2
#brief "Tilea is a human realm of fractious city states to the south of Bretonnia and The Empire. Their armed forces are largely made of mercenaries from Tilea and the neighbouring human realms of Araby, the Border Princes, and Estalia. They also use mercenary mages which gives them good magical diversity and can hire unique Regiments of Renown."
#descr "The human realms of Tilea, Estalia, and the Border Princes sit at the edges of the Old World and lack the unified nation strength of The Empire or Bretonnia; they are fractious lands where the rulers of cities frequently do battle with each other and control over swathes of territory can change quickly. Each of these realms makes extensive use of mercenaries rather than more traditional means to form armies and it is said that any man with a strong will and a quick sword arm can make his fortune there, with a little luck. Tilea is the foremost of the three realms and acts as a centre of trade, coin, and mercenary work for much of the Old World and beyond."
#summary "Race: Humans. Prefer coastal start
Military: Mercenary infantry and cavalry with reduced resource and rp costs. Powerful unique Regiments of Renown.
Magic: Expensive access to most paths
Priests: Weak and few in number
Economy: Master traders: 5% flat extra gold income and a further 20% extra in coastal forts.
Mechanics: Randomised mage and RoR contracts."

----- Actual RoR

-- Manann's Blades (nautical marienburg sellswords)
-- Asarnil the Dragonlord (Badass elf warrior on a dragon)
-- Bronzino's Gallopers (can't have them be artillery, so maybe they can just be outriders? Could give them blunderbusses invented by leonardo da miragliano)


----- Vague but real RoR

https://forums.totalwar.com/discussion/189962/dogs-of-war-compilation/p2

-- Akhibar's deathdealers (dwarfs)
-- Old Funder's Boys (ogres?)
-- Thrugg's Barbarians (barbarians)
-- Gorskulls' War Trolls (stone trolls?)
-- anakonda's amazon's (and amazon serpent priestess?)
-- skarloc's wood elf archers (explain why they were exiled)
-- prince ulther's imperial dwarfs (rewrite these so they are Dwarfs from the Empire)
-- Gunther Shepke's Grudgebringer Infantry (dark omen)
-- Torston Treehaka's Sea Axes (sailing norse dwarfs with throwing axes and two handed axes)
-- Van Klumpf's Buccaneers (buccaneers from marienburg, vicious reputation)
-- Vannheim's 75th (disciplined heavy cavalry)
-- Von Kragsburg Guard (imperial halberdiers from averland)
-- Nightmare Legion (Well equipped skeletons)
-- Ghazak Khan's Blackwolf Clan -- he's very powerful, better than ogla khan, as are his troops. So this is just an especially good one to get. Rides a giant black wolf, much bigger than normal (maybe just beef up a normal wolf?) and his lads all ride on black wolves too. They're sort of a Golden Horde stand in
-- Knights of Origo (knights on foot, sword and shield, their captain has sailing and antlers on his helm)
-- knights of the cleansing flame (on foot, shield and weird wavy spear)
-- throg's hobgoblin despoilers (hobgoblin infantry)
-- Thorston Treehacker's Sea Axes (norse dwarf longboat dudes)
-- Ruglud's Armoured Orcs (orcs with armour and crossbows, led by Ruglud Bonechewer)


----- my original ROR ideas to flesh out the rosters if needed

-- Lin Chong's Red Spears (imperial noble plus imperial spear troops)
-- high elf rangers representing non-ulthuan elf holdouts
-- araby camel riders
-- steam tank prototype made by leonardo
-- black orc mercs (the original lighter armoured kind) - can use the idea of Eeze Ugezod's Mother Crushers here but less stupid
-- vampire pirate and his crew
-- goblin wolfriders
-- goblin boss leading some goblin trash
-- knights encarmine led by Fiore Blanco

These warriors did not return to agricultural labour during the farming season, or assist in the construction of great works, but instead trained and fought year round and were known for their skill on the battlefield. Just as in their former lives, they are sought after additions to the army of any Tomb King. Like any other common undead of Nehekhara they were not buried with any particular ritual or preservation but are not mindless and are hard to banish. Nehekharan Warriors favour the use of two light blades and forgo the traditional shield, relying on a more offensive style of fighting.

Entombed with little more prestige than the common infantry, these riders are now raised by Tomb Kings as an auxiliary to support Charioteers, or to flank the foe and cut down vulnerable targets.

These guards were given the finest equipment, the best training, and represented the highest station of prestige a commoner could hope to reach. When not deployed in battle they lived lives of comparative luxury, but their true reward lay beyond their death, for as the personal guards of the King they would serve him in the eternal beauty of the afterlife. Being highly favoured by their King and entombed within royal Tomb pyramids, the now risen Tomb Guard benefit from burial rituals far more sophisticated than those afforded to their lessers; in addition to preserving more of their memories in undeath, this lends them a supernatural toughness and resistance to hostile magic. The traditional weapon of the Tomb Guard is the khopesh, a curved hacking weapon peculiar to and perfected by ancient Nehekhara. The weapons of the Tomb Guard are imbued with powerful incantations by the Mortuary Cult and have only grown more deadly over thousands of years in the Tomb.

#descr "The ancient Nehekharan pantheon consisted of many gods, but none more venerated and powerful than Ptra, the Great Father, first to tread the world. Ptra created the human race in his image and elevated the Nehekharans above all others, blessing them with his wisdom, glory, and the promise of an afterlife by his side for those who made the proper offerings. Each of the gods were served by their own priests and some had armed followers dedicated to keeping their sacred sites safe, but only the sacred warriors of Asaph and Ptra were forces powerful enough to rival the armies of Tomb Kings. The Guardians of Ptra carried spears blessed with the Great Father's burning wrath capable of searing unholy creatures from existence; they acted as a vital vanguard in the battles which saw Nagash defeated in the first great war against the necromancer. Though Ptra is now greatly diminished from the time of ancient Nehekhara his Guardians may still be raised to battle in his name at the command of the Tomb Kings. Being blessed by Ptra they are surrounded by a blinding light when they battle under the sun, for the Great Father's gaze falls kindly upon them still.

Each of the gods were served by their own priests and some had armed followers dedicated to keeping their sacred sites safe, but only the sacred warriors of Asaph and Ptra were forces powerful enough to rival the armies of Tomb Kings.

The rituals that animate the Stalkers are complex and grant them both great resilience and a gaze capable of turning the flesh of mortals to marble. Even if the unfortunate target of the Stalker's gaze is not entirely changed to stone, they may well suffer terrible injuries as parts of them crumble into sand.

#descr "Hierotitans were constructed to stand within the uppermost chamber of a Royal Tomb, acting as spirit guides for the deceased Kings and ushering them between the mortal world and the glorious afterlife. No expense was spared in their construction and their forms are lavished with gold and jewels. In one hand the Hierotitan carries an ornate staff bearing the hieroglyph of the Sun God Ptra, to light the way through the abyss that separates the mortal world from the afterlife and ward away the Daemons that sometimes prowl there. The Hierotitan's other hand carries the scales on which the soul of the King shall be judged by Usirian the God of the Underworld. Both of these items are potent magical artifacts, with the scales capable of unleashing holy judgement upon the foe and the staff able to emit beams of light that spare the servants of Nehekhara while scouring the enemy from existence. Within each Hierotitan is the mummified form of a great High Priest from the Mortuary Cult who died before the discovery of the secrets that allowed them to cheat death; it is this form which animates the Hierotitan and gives them their holy purpose. Such is the power of the Hierotitan that it spreads the dominion of Nehekhara with its presence and increases the winds of magic wherever it treads.

#name "Necropolis Knight"
#descr "Necropolis Knights are members of the Tomb Guard who ride atop giant snake-shaped statues known as Necroserpents. Necroserpents were originally sculpted to guard the entranceways to the temples of the Mortuary Cult, many of them taking the guise of the infamous hooded Khemrian cobra, though with embellishments of skulls and other death imgaery. The venom of the Khemrian cobra was legendary, able to cause total paralysis within a matter of seconds, and the fangs of the Necroserpents mysteriously drip with the same substance. At the foot of each Necroserpent statue lay a small tomb containing the remains of one who, despite years of honourable service in the elite forces of his King, felt he had become in some way dishonoured and had sacrificed his life to the Cobra god Qu'aph, whose venom can cleanse any sin. With the rise of the Tomb Kings and undead Nehekhara the souls of these fallen soldiers were bound to the statues and they awoke as one, powerful knights in service of their King once again. Should the Knight be struck down the Necroserpent will fight on and if victorious the remains of the rider will reassemble to ride atop his bonded mount once more.

They once lived in the mountains to the east of Nehekhara and would descend to feast on the slain and wounded in the wake of great battles; no commoner dared raise a hand against them for they were sacred beasts, agents of Ualatp, who bore the spirits of lost warriors to the sky to battle Daemons in an unending war. Some Kings sought to seize the favour of Ualatp and his warrior hosts in the afterlife and so had Carrion embalmed and entombed alongside them by the thousands. When the Tomb Kings arose so too did the Carrion and now they prowl Nehekhara once more and are often bound to the will of Liche Priests in service of a King. Unlike most Nehekharan undead Carrion are known to disobey the bidding of their master and flee battle at times, for they retain their animalistic sense of self preservation. As agents of Ualatp even in death the Carrion are sacred.

Though long dead they have become infused with dark magics of undeath over the centuries and can be returned to a state of animation by a simple incantation from even a minor Liche Priest. Most of these scuttling creatures are resigned to the duty of cleaning up the remains of interlopers to the Tomb Kings' realm, but the reanimated corpse of the Khepra Scorpion, a particularly large and aggressive variety found only in Nehekhara, is often used in battle to overwhelm or distract enemy troops. Though these creatures are dangerous pests alone, in sufficient numbers they become a terrifying tide of chitinous death rolling over the desert, swarming over and stinging to death anything that lives."

Only in service to Khemri, though, would the Mortuary Cult animate these massive statues to wage war, tearing through the enemy ranks with a howdah of elite soldiers on their back. With the rise of the Tomb Kings the Warsphinxes are once more being awakened, now crewed by Tomb Guard, to once more devastate the enemies of Nehekhara. Warsphinxes are incredibly hardly, nearly industructible by normal means, and are capable of breathing gouts of fire said to be drawn from the endless funeral pyres of the unworthy dead.

Unfortunately this very network of operatives was one of the first places Nagash was able to corrupt and use to increase his power and it was not allowed to survive the first overthrow of the foul Necromancer. After the fall of Nehekhara and the rise of the Tomb Kings, such clandestine operations remained out of the question, and when a scout is needed a skeletal Horseman is enchanted with somewhat expensive inscriptions of stealth and misdirection before being sent to watch for enemy activity. As such simple constructs they require no upkeep.

#descr "In ancient Nehekhara every King and Prince could call upon their own personal Herald, a bodyguard, standard bearer, and champion that represented their master in martial matters beneath their attention. Heralds were selected from the best of the elite bodyguards and had to pass a gauntlet of trials of bravery, skill, and endurance. In battle they wore ceremonial armour and bore an icon of their master at all times while wearing a golden mask in the likeness of their ruler. Upon the death of the King or Prince the Herald was ritually sacrificed and placed guard at the entrance to their Tomb chamber. Though Heralds were not mummified the rituals preserving them and proximity to their ruler have granted them considerable physical strength and magical resistance, in addition to almost fully preserving the memories of their former life. Heralds, as representatives of members of a royal dynasty, have considerable martial authority and are considered sacred, though they cannot command the magically animated constructs of Nehekhara.

#descr "The Mortuary Cult was established as a true power during the reign of Settra, the first King to unify the warring city states of Nehekhara into an empire, as they both prolonged his life considerably and made many promises of the glorious afterlife that awaited him. As the centuries passed the Mortuary Cult mastered the art of extending their own lives, while the Kings of Nehekhara shifted their attention almost entirely to journeying into the afterlife via complex funerary rites and massive and elaborate Royal Tombs. Eventually the members of the Mortuary Cult conquered death, but in doing so slipped into a withered, wizened state virtually indistinguishable from undeath, preserving their husklike bodies by tethering them to their eternal souls. So they became known as the Liche Priesthood. When Nagash returned and slew every living soul in Nehekhara through the Great Ritual, the Liche Priests escaped this fate and laid low, emerging once Nagash was defeated and the Ritual undone to once more serve the freed Tomb Kings, desperately trying to placate their wrath upon finding their afterlife was one of undeath and desolation. Acolytes are the most numerous and lowest status members of the Priesthood of the Mortuary Cult and were responsible for the majority of day to day observances and burial rites in ancient Nehekhara. They are not particularly magically powerful and have little priestly authority, but without their constant work the Tomb Kings would see Nehekhara slowly fall silent and motionless for good.

#descr "In life Necrotects were the artisans and engineers that designed and oversaw the construction of the great monuments, pyraminds, and Royal Tombs of ancient Nehekhara, as well as the countless statues that could be called to war. Theirs was a highly demanding profession that carried great prestige and those with talent were highly sought after by competing members of the Mortuary Cult, dynastic Royals and even the most powerful Priest Kings. Upon their death they were inevitably granted expensive burial rites and mummification and entombed alongside their masters that they might continue to serve in the glorious afterlife. Their status has only risen since Nehekhara's fall and rise once more as a land of undeath ruled by the Tomb Kings, for the Necrotects are repositories of knowledge from their respective eras that would otherwise be totally lost, and their importance is further highlighted by the fact their works still dominate the Nehekharan landscape. While in life the Necrotects had no magical power in death they are blessed with a new connection to the arcana of sand, stone, death, and shadow. In battle they constantly chant mantras with the power to heal damage dealt to the animated statues of Nehekhara.

#name "Cursed Scarab Prince"
#descr "Apophas was an ambitious and jealous prince of Numas who covted the throne of that city. To this end he drugged and slit the throats of the entire royal line, declaring himself King. He proved a ruthless but unpopular ruler and lost the support of the Mortuary Cult, leaving him vulberable to a rebellion which saw him dragged to the temple for judgement. His punishment was severe: to be devoured by scarab beetles such that he would never reach the glorious afterlife. All that was left of Apophas was his skull, which was marked with cursed glyphs and cast into the desert. Apophas' soul was claimed by Usirian, God of the Underworld, but Apophas struck a bargain with the deity: he would return to the world and find a soul even more ruthless and ambitious than his own to replace him in the Underworld. Usirian agreed, but returned Apophas to the mortal realms in the guise of a writhing swarm of scarab beetles, armed with a blade that can reap souls. Usirian now seeks out the most powerful and dangerous foes that he might finally find a soul to match his own and be freed from his eternal servitude. Should Apophas be struck down within the dominion of Nehehkhara he will swiftly return to undeath, indeed he has been known at times to disperse and reform within seconds.

#descr "Khatep is the Grand Hierophant of Khemri, the head of the Mortuary Cult's hieratic council, and he alone knows all of its secrets and unwritten lore. He is the oldest and wisest of the Liche Priests, said to be the very first of their number to successfully stave of death. Following Nagash's Great Ritual which killed the entire population of Nehekhara and then animated and bound every last one of the dead, entombed or otherwise, to his will, Khatep and his followers waited for their moment to take action. Nagash, felled at the height of his power by the sole living human in Nehekhara, lost control of the Tomb Kings and the proud monarchs, free willed once more and full of wrath, each sought to reign their former realms supreme. So began a great and terrible civil war of the dead. It was Khatep who took decisive action; he broke the seals of the Tomb of Settra, the only such structure to have resisted the power of the Great Ritual, and personally awoke the greatest of the Nehehkharan Kings. Settra quickly restored a new order to Nehekhara, but turned on Khatep with a great and terrible fury, for he had been promised an eternal glorious afterlife in paradise, not rulership of a fallen land of undeath. Khatep was banished to the desert, only to return when Nehehkhara could be restored to the promised paradise. With the coming of the War of Ascension, Khatep has returned to serve the Tomb Kings, and Settra, once more.

According to half eroded scripture on the oldest monuments they were the personal guard of the Nehekharan Gods who guarded against the incursion of daemons. The Mortuary Cult, at the height of their power before the rise of Nagash, constructed their own giant sentinels in honour of these legends, skeletal titans made of black marble known as Necrolith Colossi. To each Colossus was bound the spirit of a heroic warrior, a willing sacrifice made to protect the Tomb of their King that he might reach the glorious afterlife promised to him. By calling out to the spirit of the warrior still bound to the silent Colossus and infusing its black marble bones with magic, the caster awakens one of these protectors of Nehekhara to march to war once more. The awakened Colossus will be armed with either a massive khopesh or a powerful bow capable of drawing power from the underworld."

Sepulchral Stalkers were created by the ancient Nehekharans to dilineate the borders of a King's realm. They are statues that have the boy of a snake and the upper torso of a man, topped with a thoroughly inhuman and repulsive skull-like visage. Stalkers are instinctively able to hunt down and ambush trespassers and are extremely quick, making them excellent patrollers, well feared by any who would dare tread the land of Nehekhara seeking to find treasure in the many ruins. The rituals that animate the Stalkers are complex and grant them both great resilience and a gaze capable of turning the flesh of mortals to marble."

The venom of the Khemrian cobra was legendary, able to cause total paralysis within a matter of seconds, and the fangs of the Necroserpents mysteriously drip with the same substance. At the foot of each Necroserpent statue lay a small tomb containing the remains of one who, despite years of honourable service in the elite forces of his King, felt he had become in some way dishonoured and had sacrificed his life to the Cobra god Qu'aph, whose venom can cleanse any sin."

Carrion are giant undead birds that resemble great black vultures but are many more times more aggressive. Thousands of these terrible birds were entombed alongside Kings who sought to gain the favour of Ualatp the Scavenger God of lost soldiers and they returned when the Tomb Kings arose and regained their will. As agents of Ualatp even in death the Carrion are sacred."

#selectnation 112
#name "Nehekhara"
#epithet "Tomb Kings"
#descr "The lands of Nehekhara were once vast and fertile and for more than a thousand years it prospered and grew in influence, ruled by Priest Kings, each of whom controlled a city state. Greatest amongst the Priest Kings was Settra, first to unify Nehekhara under his authority, and it was Settra who brought the Mortuary Cult to power, for he wished to find a way to conquer death itself and rule eternally. Though the Cult could prolong the lives of their rulers greatly, they could not stave off death entirely, and instead promised a future glorious eternal afterlife. This promise led directly to the Nehekharan obsession with death and countless tombs were created to house the Royal families of Nehekhara as generations passed, until the riches of the dead far outweighed those of the living. Nehekhara's fate came in the form of Nagash, a genius Priest turned Necromancer who wrought the Great Ritual that laid waste to the land, slew every living soul, and bound the dead to his will in a state of undeath. Nagash was fortunately defeated and the risen Kings of Nehekhara regained their free will, but found they now ruled over a blasted land of undeath. Yet mummified undead Kings are Kings still, generations of rulers accustomed to unquestioned authority and power, and they now set forth with their numberless undead legions and animated statues to reclaim their lost empire."
#summary "Race: undead humans, prefers Heat Scale +2, halved income and pop loss from death
Military: shielded infantry, archers, and chariots with powerful and resilient animated statues
Magic: Death with Fire, Air, Astral, and Earth
Priests: Strong, with chants that strengthen the undead
Mechanics: No indies or mercs, troops have no upkeep, death scale gold discount, statues require lab and temple, recruitment unlocks at dominion 1, 2, 4, 6"
#brief "Nehekhara was once a mighty nation of city states until its entire population was struck down by the necromancer Nagash and raised as his undead servants. With his defeat the Tomb Kings are free willed once more but cursed with undeath and obsessed with rebuilding their shattered kingdoms."

#descr "Though beliefs in the afterlife differ across faiths and cultures across the world, all know that in some cases a spirit does not find rest or move on and becomes a grave danger to the living. Tortured Spirits are those souls unfortunate enough to be partly bound to the mortal realm by some unforgiven crime, terrible secret, eternal vow, or unreleased trauma. Vampires and Necromancers have long made use of such Spirits by simply dominating them with dark magic, rendering them mindless puppets to use against the enemy. Such Spirits are ethereal and very difficult to harm with mortal weapons but quite capable of tearing a man apart with their claws or chilling his heart with the cold of the grave. Tortured Spirits can be expensive to bind, but require no upkeep.

#descr "Much like Tortured Spirits or Wraiths, Banshees are ethereal creatures that result from an unquiet soul infused with dark magic. Tomb Banshees were once noblewomen, sorceresses, and witches who committed great acts of evil in life and upon death drew so much dark magic to their resting place that their embittered spirit broke free and roamed the land seeking vengeance on the living. Banshees exist in a state of constant torment and grief for their lost life and deeply resent the warmth and joy of the living, a state they are more than happy to punish with their soul-rending wails and fell blades. Tomb Banshees are difficult to bind, but make highly potent servants for any Vampire and are often sent to take the life of enemy commanders, a task which the bitter spirit is all to eager to carry out.

Even the most depraved, violent, or bestial Vampire will have the sense to allow these cults to work in their favour and will largely refrain from devouring them, using them in experiments, or turning them into undead fodder as long as they make themselves useful. They are easily recognisable by their use of masks in the visage of human skulls.

Lacking a true physical form, they are extremely difficult to defeat with mundane weapons and even the strongest of faith find them difficult to banish. Worse still, their icy touch and spectral scythes are able to bypass even the thickest armour or toughest hide with relative ease. Cairn Wraiths are born from the remains of those humans who dabbled in the arts of sorcery long before the rise of necromancers or the colleges of magic, at a time when the dangers of harnessing the winds were either not understood or frequently ignored. These ancient sorcerers used dark magic to prolong their lives, but over time their physical forms decayed or began to simply fade out of existence, and their tribes entombed them in great cairns all over the world. Their spirits lived on though, sustained by echoing sorcery and drawing energy from the suffering of others. Vampires and Necromancers have learned to bind Cairn Wraiths to their will and are known to deploy them as shock troops capable of slaughtering elites and routing entire regiments. So unnatural are Cairn Wraiths that their presence fills the air with an aura of horror that gnaws at the hearts of even hardened soldiers. While binding Cairn Wraiths is a costly process, they require no payment to carry out their implacable task.

#name "Hexwraith"
#descr "While Cairn Wraiths are primarily feared for their nigh invulnerability to mundane weapons and implacable, silent slaughter of any who stand before them, the similar entities known as Hexwraiths are terrifying for an additional reason. Even dying to their scythes is no escape, for it is said they can drag the souls of sinners to a realm of damnation, a place of eternal burning torture in proportion to one's past misdeeds. Indeed their weapons are shrouded in an invisible flame which burns and destroys any which the Hexwraith judges to have sin within them, which includes any living beings that stand in the way of its mission. Hexwraiths are known for riding after their prey on spectral steeds of great speed capable of simply passing through any terrain in their path; they have even been known to slay men in locked rooms by simply riding through solid brick and mortar and snatching their soul. Vampires and Necromancers can bind Hexwraiths to their will, but it is notoriously difficult and only the Necrarch bloodline has been able to consistently deploy them in battle. Unlike Cairn Wraiths their grip on this world is not bound to any physical object and as such they are easier to destroy, especially by magical means. Like Cairn Wraiths they care nothing for gold and require no upkeep.

#descr "Vargheists are Vampires who, newly given the Blood Kiss, failed to feed and reached a point of near total starvation before being released on a rampage of gluttonous slaughter and blood drinking. Occasionally this happens naturally as a mortal unwilling to accept their new state locks themselves away only to become so desperate to feed they break free from their restraints, but usually it is the doing of a master purposely acting to create a Vargheist. Within every Vampire lurks a bestial chiropterate aspect which wishes only to hunt and feed, a nature which is drawn out through starvation and then greatly accelerated by a sudden glut of blood. The physical form of Vargheists is even more warped than the least humanoid Strigoi or Necrarchs, their clawed arms sprouting batlike wings that allow them to take to the air to hunt down prey. Though they are technically still Vampires their once sharp minds are almost entirely subsumed by their predatory instincts and they can be bound to the will of a master just like lesser undead. Vargheists are most commonly used by the Von Carstein and Strigoi Bloodlines.

#descr "Vampires are quick to make use of the Necromancers, occultists, and other mortals who seek to gain power or knowledge in their employ, but there are times when they need a locus for their dark magic which is entirely bound to them while still having some vestige of a mind of its own. Revenants are animated for this purpose; effectively their body is just that of a typical soulless, but rather than simply being controlled by the Vampire like a barely autonomous puppet, they are instead filled with the faded spirit of a long ago slain practicioner of dark magic. Revenants can command undead and have a basic level of death magic but make very poor researchers, as their spirits are faded and unable to think creatively or form new memories. Revenants require no upkeep.

#descr "All Vampires have some degree of innate necromantic ability and command over the dead and undead alike, for their creation stems from an imperfect copy of Nagash's Elixir of Life, created by the Great Necromancer to allow his disciples to eternally serve as free-willed but loyal commanders of his armies of the dead. As such, all Vampires naturally make use of the remains of mortals to raise both Longdead warriors and shambling Soulless, no matter what Bloodline they descend from. Such undead may be quickly and temporarily raised in battle, or more permanently raised through necromantic rituals, unholy rites, or innate dark powers, but there is always a cost in time, magic, effort, gold, or other resources. As necromancy is able to reanimate any manner of skeletal remains, some necromancers reanimate equine remains as well as those of humans in order to create undead cavalry. These Longdead Horsemen are no match for the infamous Black Knights, but are far more readily available. As with any Longdead they require no upkeep of gold.

Much like the Grave Guard they are Wights, the animated remains of ancient warriors who were entombed in full battle gear, but while the ancient human kingdoms had many proud and ferocious warriors, horses were a relatively rare symbol of wealth and power. In life Black Knights were typically the closest warriors of ancient chieftains and kings, men of status whose steeds were ritually slaughtered and entombed alongside them upon their deaths. As such their equipment, though seemingly rusted and worn, is of the finest quality, and their skill at arms is considerable. While finding and reanimating these ancient cavalrymen is expensive, they require no upkeep of gold.

Wight Kings make excellent warrior-generals for Vampires who have managed to source their remains, being both skilled and very difficult to destroy. Their equipment, though seemingly rusted and worn, is of the finest quality and invariably inscribed with runes of dark sorcery by the shaman of their tribe. While finding and reanimating these ancient kings is expensive, they require no upkeep of gold. Wight Kings, unlike lesser Wights, retain some degree of their own mind rather than being puppets of the Vampire, though they have no desire to do anything but serve the one who has bound them.

Being natives of Sylvania they have been sworn to The Oath since birth and if struck down in battle their bodies will immediately rise as soulless undead to continue serving the Von Carsteins.

They are an organisation of men well versed in hunting, tracking, and warfare who are quite accustomed to living in the forests for months at a time, rooting out threats and maintaining the land at the behest of the aristocracy. The intake of recruits to the Wardens is left entirely to their own discretion and they are known for their brutal and exacting requirements; some hopeful aspirants simply do not survive their trial of entry. As such they are a very proud fighting force and loathe to retreat in battle. Being natives of Sylvania they have been sworn to The Oath since birth and if struck down in battle their bodies will immediately rise as soulless undead to continue serving the Von Carsteins.

#descr "When Vlad Von Carstein first arrived to take power in Sylvania, he found the province in a terrible state; plague stalked the lands, bandit gangs roamed freely preying on the common folk, peasants murdered tax collectors, monsters stalked the land, and the nobility were firmly entrenched in a seemingly endless and bloody civil war. The one exception to this hellish state of misrule and anarchy was the Knightly Order of the Rose, a secular force of sworn nobles who in all they did attempted to hold the social order of Sylvania and maintain the province through strength of will and arms. So impressed was Vlad that even as he crushed the rebellious nobles, fought off the Empire, and instilled his absolute rule he made every effort to spare the Order of the Rose. Still, they were sworn to battle evil in all forms and identified the Von Carsteins as creatures of darkness, so conflict was inevitable. The Order fought bravely and even after losing the majority of their number were loathe to surrender to the Vampires, holding out in their chapter house for a full year even after all hope was lost. Finally, Vlad made them an offer they could not refuse, particularly after he personally slew their Grand Master. They would remain mortals, their bodies would never be subject to The Oath, and their loyalty would be first to Sylvania, then to the Von Carsteins. Since that day the Order have fought in protection of Sylvania, even against incursions by their former masters in the Empire, and have come to embrace their role as paladins of the Church of The Oath, believing the common folk achieve the peaceful bliss of the afterlife through promising their bodies to serve after death, while the Orders knights earn it through their virtue and service in battle.

#descr "Mutated by exposure to dark magic, the Vampire Bats which inevitably flock to the presence of the aristocracy of the night are far more aggressive and ravenous for blood than their natural counterparts. Though they are individually weak they are quite capable of draining men dry of blood or simply tearing them to pieces when they descend on their pray in large numbers. There is a bestial chiropterate affinity deep within all Vampires, but its strength varies consdiderably between the Bloodlines. The Von Carsteins have the greatest control over and affection for Vampire Bats and are even able to transform into a cloud of bats themselves to travel long distances. All Bloodlines are able to use the creatures as scouts, as they can all innately reach out with their minds and use the bat's senses as if they were their own. Being simple beasts dominated by the will of a vampire, these creatures need no upkeep in gold.

#descr "With a body as large as a grown man, Fell Bats are a fearsome sight. The are darker than midnight and silent as death, even when in full flight. In fact the only noises that a Fell Bat makes on the hunt are the horrible gobbling slurps as it sinks its fangs into flesh. In truth, a Fell Bat bears as much resemblance as an ordinary bat as a maddened lion would to a domestic cat. Those who have encountered them tell of how they hunt with unerring accuracy, swooping down to knock lone riders from their saddles or pick off straggling soldiers before they are aware of any threat. Fell Bats are most common in Sylvania but can be found across much of the world and are always drawn to Vampires, for all Vampires harbour a bestial chiropterate affinity deep within themselves, though it is far stronger in some Bloodlines. Fell Bats are most commonly used in war by the Von Carsteins and the savage Strigoi.

They are also well known for their ability to shift into the form of a cloud of bats to travel great distances, though the process is tiring and they would never use it in battle. Despite their balanced abilities the Von Carsteins have developed certain weaknesses over hundreds of years; namely a compulsive inability to cross running water, a vulnerability to fire, and a reduced resistance to hostile magic and divine symbols. In addition to their considerable necromantic abilities and understanding of blood some have embraced their hidden bestial nature to develop their talents in the magic of the wilds, while others have studied the secretive lore of shadow and wind, or delved further into decadent blood rituals.

#descr "Sylvania is a densely forested province which is plagued by all manner of evils. Giant spiders, beastmen, trolls, wolves, bandits, and even greenskins can be found in the woods, each threatening the safety of the Sylvanian peasantry. It is the duty of the Wardens to combat these threats. Gameskeepers are the commanders of the Wardens and in addition to the duties of their organisation are sworn to root out dissent to the rule of the Von Carsteins. Being natives of Sylvania they have been sworn to The Oath since birth and if struck down in battle their bodies will immediately rise as soulless undead to continue serving the Von Carsteins. Gameskeepers are always accompanied by a small pack of Sylvanian Hounds.

#name "Knight Commander of the Rose"
#descr "When Vlad Von Carstein first arrived to take power in Sylvania, he found the province in a terrible state; plague stalked the lands, bandit gangs roamed freely preying on the common folk, peasants murdered tax collectors, monsters stalked the land, and the nobility were firmly entrenched in a seemingly endless and bloody civil war. The one exception to this hellish state of misrule and anarchy was the Knightly Order of the Rose, a secular force of sworn nobles who in all they did attempted to hold the social order of Sylvania and maintain the province through strength of will and arms. So impressed was Vlad that even as he crushed the rebellious nobles, fought off the Empire, and instilled his absolute rule he made every effort to spare the Order of the Rose. Still, they were sworn to battle evil in all forms and identified the Von Carsteins as creatures of darkness, so conflict was inevitable. The Order fought bravely and even after losing the majority of their number were loathe to surrender to the Vampires, holding out in their chapter house for a full year even after all hope was lost. Finally, Vlad made them an offer they could not refuse, particularly after he personally slew their Grand Master. They would remain mortals, their bodies would never be subject to The Oath, and their loyalty would be first to Sylvania, then to the Von Carsteins. Since that day the Order have fought in protection of Sylvania, even against incursions by their former masters in the Empire, and have come to embrace their role as paladins of the Church of The Oath, believing the common folk achieve the peaceful bliss of the afterlife through promising their bodies to serve after death, while the Orders knights earn it through their virtue and service in battle. Knight Commanders of the Order are given priestly authority by the Church of The Oath.

#descr "When Vlad took control of Sylvania he knew that fear of his wrath, secrecy about the nature of the vampiric aristocracy, feudal hierarchy long established in the province, and the promise of protection from marauding bandits and monsters would be enough to prevent an uprising in the short term, but he desired an empire that would stand for millennia. He could perhaps have systematically eradicated the population and raised them as unthinking servants, but ruling over a land of the dead held little interest to him. Nor did he find the idea of hiding his nature for good either appealing or realistic. Thus he created The Oath, binding the physical forms of the population to the Von Carstein house, and established a new faith to promote a social order to his liking. The central message of the Church of The Oath is that through service to the Von Carsteins the souls of the common folk will be granted a blessed and peaceful afterlife, for the mortal body is simply a vessel; one which will continue to serve its rightful rulers even after the soul has departed. The Vampires, seen in this light, have made a noble sacrifice to live on near eternally fulfilling their duty as rulers and protectors of the people and going without the blessful rest the common man can know upon death. The teachings of the Church are widespread and, coupled with more authoritarian measures, quite effective in keeping the common folk in line. Priests of The Oath are instantly recognisable for their dark robes and ritual bloodying of one hand to represent the sacrifices that must be made by all. They have little martial authority but are able to lead some small number of the undead.

These pilgrims often join the Knight in battle and tend to live rather short and bloody lives - all for the promise of seeing their living idol reach the Grail. The Pilgrims of the Blood Grail trace their origins back to this practice; they are descended from those Pilgrims who had the terrible truth of the Grail Lie revealed to them as their Questing Knight was dueled, defeated, and given the Blood Kiss by a powerful Blood Dragon Vampire. Their former faith exposed as a Wood Elf manipulation, some Pilgrims chose to serve a new master no more human than the elves, but far more honest and offering the promise of revenge against their former society. Pilgrims of the Blood Grail have become just as zealous in their loyalty and service to Blood Dragons as their Bretonnian counterparts are to their Knights and as such are sacred to those who worship the Vampires. Many of them bear injuries from their years dutifully following in the footsteps of a Vampire seeking greater and greater challenges."

Only the oldest and most powerful of the Bloodline are permitted to take the title of Blood Dragon. These Vampires have cooled some of their lust for blood and have greater inherent magical abilities in addition to their supernatural physical prowess and near perfected martial skills. They ride into battle on the backs of Winged Nightmares, armed with fell magical weaponry, and are virtually unmatched on the battlefield.

#descr "No Vampire is careless in their gift of the Blood Kiss and the conversion of a mortal to a member of their Bloodline, for though they will naturally be more powerful than their younger offspring, a poorly chosen child could cause them no end of trouble. One would expect, then, that the notoriously exacting Blood Dragons would have typically have fewer family members than the other Bloodlines, save perhaps the reclusive Necrarchs, but this is not the case. Blood Dragons are known to convert entire Knightly Orders, simply slaying those who refuse their gifts. There are several reasons for this tendency, but above all it is driven by the innate desire for military cohesion and the bonds of a warrior band the Bloodline has inherited from its originator Abhorash. Blood Knights are humans from across the Old World who have sworn fealty to a Blood Dragon as their grandmaster in exchange for power and the eternal pursuit of martial honour. Being young Vampires they are far less powerful than the Blood Drakes and Dragons that lead them, but as heavy cavalry are only rivalled by the Chaos Knights of the Ruinous Powers, or perhaps the Grail Knights of Bretonnia. They ride into battle wearing fine armour atop aggressive warhorses, as they do not have the power to create their own Nightmare mounts. Unlike their younger fellows true Blood Knights require undead leadership.

#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Lahmians, descendents of the first Vampire, Neferata, are focused on the natural vampiric ability to manipulate and charm mortals. The Lahmians are arguably the most cohesive Bloodline, still ruled by their founder and almost all committed to a single faction, the Lahmian Sisterhood. The Sisterhood's goal is to reclaim their lost city of Lahmia, to restore it to its former glory with a population of obedient mortals, and ultimately control the world. Lahmians are connoisseurs of human blood with an innate talent for blood magic in addition to their necromantic powers and remaining knowledge of the arcane arts of ancient Khemri. They are well known for their incredible ability to beguile, charm, manipulate, or simply hypnotically dominate mortals, skills which they rigorously sharpen by competing with fellow Sisters in the world of courtly affairs and aristocratic politics. Lahmians are not so physically powerful as their fellows but are exceptionally fast and graceful and would be difficult for any but the most elite opponent to strike down. Lahmians of the First Circle are few in number but extremely powerful, being the most trusted agents of Neferata.

#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Lahmians, descendents of the first Vampire, Neferata, are focused on the natural vampiric ability to manipulate and charm mortals. The Lahmians are arguably the most cohesive Bloodline, still ruled by their founder and almost all committed to a single faction, the Lahmian Sisterhood. The Sisterhood's goal is to reclaim their lost city of Lahmia, to restore it to its former glory with a population of obedient mortals, and ultimately control the world. Lahmians are connoisseurs of human blood with an innate talent for blood magic in addition to their necromantic powers and remaining knowledge of the arcane arts of ancient Khemri. They are well known for their incredible ability to beguile, charm, manipulate, or simply hypnotically dominate mortals, skills which they rigorously sharpen by competing with fellow Sisters in the world of courtly affairs and aristocratic politics. Lahmians are not so physically powerful as their fellows but are exceptionally fast and graceful and would be difficult for any but the most elite opponent to strike down. Lahmians of the Second Circle are experienced members of the Sisterhood but not nearly so powerful as their older siblings.

One of their most successful and widely used creations is the Blood Revenant, a typical Revenant infused with a mortal heart cursed to forever pump diseased blood through the corpse. Blood Revenants trade their necromantic ability for an affinity for simple blood magic. This is useful to the Necrarchs because while they very rarely drink mortal blood any more, they always need fresh blood slaves for their experiments. Like other Revenants they make poor researchers but require no upkeep.

They are effectively zombies, also known as Soulless, of incredible size and strength, but unlike Soulless they are infused with great quantities of death magic and are far harder to banish or otherwise destroy. Amongst the Vampire Bloodlines it is typically only the Necrarchs that have the power and knowledge to field these abominations, though in rare cases the servants of other Bloodlines have managed to provide their masters with a Corpse Giant and typically received lavish rewards in return. Corpse Giants are traditionally created from the body of a slain Giant, the kind of which is not uncommon in the Old World, but can also be created by using a patchwork of flesh from smaller beings, or alchemical means to grow humanoid soulless to a great size. However they came to be, their sheer size, toughness, and strength make them highly useful tools. As with other soulless, they require no upkeep of gold.

They are built for speed and power, usually quadrupedal and large, and armed with a crude oversized scythe. The Death Cultists that congregate around Necrarch strongholds see the Harvesters as the will of death itself made manifest and as such they have become sacred to those deluded souls.

However there are other forms of Ghoul which stand distinct, and among these the most common is the Swamp Ghoul, a truly foul species that inhabits bogs, swamps, and marshes which have become saturated with dark magic and the fallen dead, be they freshly slain or centuries old. Perhaps Swamp Ghouls were originally from the same stock as Crypt Ghouls and simply diverged in their habitat, but whatever the cause they are even further from a recognisable human lineage than their wretched cousins. Swamp Ghouls bound after their prey on all fours at impressive speed and their muck encrusted claws can strike a man with a stiffening paralysis with the merest scratch, raising the terrifying prospect of being devoured while unable to move a muscle to prevent ones fate. They lack even the base cunning of Crypt Ghouls and do not use primitive weapons, but slash with both clawed hands and even their feet. That said, they are just as craven and prone to flee from battle. While Swamp Ghouls originally emerged from swamps and fens and are capable swimmers, they are drawn to the charnel pits that are Ghoul Nests no matter where they are located and are treated by the Crypt Ghouls in much the same way humans might treat dogs.

#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Strigoi are descended from Ushoran, Prince of Lahmia and younger brother of Neferata, the first Vampire. Having been denied the Elixir of Life out of petty spite, Ushoran stole it and founded his own Bloodline, a crime for which the Strigoi would pay for hundreds of years as the other Bloodlines took every opportunity to persecute and ostracise them. In desperation after the fall of their haven of Strigos, the Strigoi turned to their inner bestial nature to survive and became monstrous creatures, physically mighty even by the standards of Vampires but a far cry from their former sophistication. Most Strigoi feed not only on blood but on flesh and even rotting corpses, a state of degeneracy which has eaten away at their minds. Strigoi are famously difficult to kill, capable of regenerating from wounds far quicker than other Bloodlines and growing ever stronger by feasting on the fallen. They have no patience for research or study but have a natural command of death magic and a connection with the wilds and the earth born from centuries spent on the run from their fellows. Most Strigoi, acting almost entirely on instinct, use no arms or armour, relying instead on slashing claws dripping with poisonous decay.

#descr "The five Vampire Bloodlines have diverged considerably from a common origin in terms of culture, physical form, temperament, and supernatural ability. The Strigoi are descended from Ushoran, Prince of Lahmia and younger brother of Neferata, the first Vampire. Having been denied the Elixir of Life out of petty spite, Ushoran stole it and founded his own Bloodline, a crime for which the Strigoi would pay for hundreds of years as the other Bloodlines took every opportunity to persecute and ostracise them. In desperation after the fall of their haven of Strigos, the Strigoi turned to their inner bestial nature to survive and became monstrous creatures, physically mighty even by the standards of Vampires but a far cry from their former sophistication. Amongst the degenerate Strigoi there are many mutations as their bodies twist to more predatory forms and their minds devolve into unreasoning savagery; the most common variant is the Wing Strigoi, an eyeless batlike horror capable of flight. Winged Strigoi are superb hunters, forgoing vision entirely in favour of supernaturally advanced auditory and olefactory senses, but are less magically talented than their more common brethren and lack their connection to the land.

Though most Strigoi have descended into a state of near feral madness, some of the oldest of their Bloodline have retained or recovered their sanity and now seek to restore Strigos to its former glory, having arranged an uneasy truce with the other Bloodlines. True Strigoi wear some of the armour their former home was famed for and are far more cunning and magically adept than their fallen kin. They feed on human blood rather than flesh or corpses but are just as difficult to kill and physically powerful. They too have a natural command of death magic and a connection with the wilds and the earth born from centuries spent on the run from their fellows.

#name "Crypt Horror"
#descr "The malformed monstrosities known as Crypt Horrors are thankfully not a common sight. Spoken of in hushed whispers by grizzled nightwatchmen, Priests of Morr, and professional hunters of the undead, they are often dismissed as exaggerated sightings of mere Crypt Ghouls, but in truth they do exist and no-one would mistake one for a Ghoul if they crossed its path. Crypt Horrors are created in times of war by ambitious or desperate Strigoi who deploy them as shock troops to break through enemy lines where Ghouls would surely falter. The reason only the fallen Strigoi are known to make use of these terrible creatures is simple; the process of their creation involves allowing a lowly Crypt Ghoul to drink the blood of the Vampire. This act is considered so base and desperate that even a Necrarch would not experiment with it, but to the the half-mad Strigoi it is an acceptable sacrifice to gain such a powerful weapon. Having fed on the fresh blood of the Strigoi the Crypt Ghoul will retreat to his nest and begin to slaughter and eat the weaker of his fellows, constantly growing in size and strength until he becmes a towering beast of muscle and unholy vigour. Bone spines coated with powerful poison erupt from his flesh and his body churns with a constant process of decay and renewal, leaving him in a state of torment and rage. Much like their lesser brethren, Crypt Horrors have a voracious appetite for rotting flesh, and they too grow harder to kill the more they are able to indulge their terrible appetites.

When Vlad disappeared he took no part in the infighting that saw his 'brother' Konrad rise to prominence, instead travelling far and wide to deepen his knowldge of necromantic lore, even going so far as to wrest secrets from the Liche Priests of Nehekhara and tomes from the ghostly necropolis of Nagashizzar. When he returned Mannfred was amongst the most powerful necromancers in existence, rivalling even the most ancient Necrarchs. Like his sire before him, Mannfred had firm designs on the throne of the Empire and was not above working with the living to ascend to power, bringing them to his side with promises of power and clever deceptions. In battle Mannfred rides atop a particularly powerful Nightmare and wields a great sickle blade in one hand and the life draining Sword of Unholy Power in the other. He is protected by the infamous Armour of Templehof, said to have been forged with the blood of scores of innocents, which grants Mannfred incredible durability. Mannfred's patience, intelligence, and significant library of stolen tomes make him an expert ritualist.

---------------- WELCOME TO VAMPIRES -----------------

#newevent
#msg "Welcome! The Warhammer Vampires nation has a special Bloodline mechanic which makes them a little different from other nations.

Starting Bloodline: Your Capital starts with a site which allows recruitment of 5 different Vampire Bloodline commanders. When you recruit one your capital will be granted sites that grant recruitment options specific to that Bloodline. This can have a significant impact, especially because each Bloodline has commanders and troops exclusive to a Capital province.

Choosing more Bloodlines: Each time you fully control a province with a fort and positive dominion, a Bloodline Selector site will spawn there. This allows you to pick a Bloodline for that province, just as you did with your Capital. You get recruitment options for that Bloodline, but this time you won't get any of the Capital exclusive recruitment options UNLESS the province is an enemy Capital you've taken. So taking an enemy Capital can be great news! If you lose control of a province where you've selected a Bloodline the selection will be erased and you'll be free to make it again if you take control and have positive dominion there.

Death Recruitment: Many of your recruitables are discounted in Death scales. Remember that this dynamically alters their gold upkeep too - it will vary depending on the Death scale of the province they're in."

#descr "The Vampires of the world are split into five distinct Bloodlines, each with its own powers, ambitions, and culture. They are the aristocratic Von Carsteins, the bestial Strigoi, the martial Blood Dragons, the manipulative Lahmians, and the arcane Necrarchs. These Bloodlines have long opposed and interfered the goals of their fellows, but with the coming of the new era they have established a tenuous alliance, though they must each have their own separate strongholds. Each Bloodline has its own favoured underlings, but all make extensive use of the undead, for all Vampires are creatures of dark magic, long ago created by an imperfect copy of dread Nagash's Elixir of Life."
#summary "Race: Five Vampire Bloodlines with mortal and undead servants. Death and Growth scales have half impact on population and income.
Military: Powerful Vampires supported by corporeal undead, ethereal spirits, and human soldiers.
Magic: Strong Death with Blood, Air, Fire, Earth, Nature, and Astral.
Priests: Below average.
Mechanics: Each fort can be granted to a Bloodline, altering recruitment options. Granting a Capital to a Bloodline allows unique recruits for the chosen Bloodline."

#brief "A nation of powerful Vampires ruling over mortals and legions of undead servants. Each fort must be granted to one of five Bloodlines, each of which has unique strengths and weaknesses."
